Apple CEO Tim Cook did the honors at the Steve Jobs Theater, noting that the Apple &ldquo;team has been hard at work for years on something that is important to all of us&rdquo;. Cook particularly referenced the tenth anniversary of the iPhone range, boldly asserting that this new smartphone release will &ldquo;set the path for technology for the next decade.&rdquo;</p><h3>iPhone 10</h3><p><br></p><p>Confusingly for fans of the smartphone series, the iPhone X aka iPhone 10 is pronounced by Apple executives at least as iPhone 10. But many of the early announced features of this smartphone were exactly as expected. With a glass front and behind, the iPhone X is designed for wireless charging; more on that later.</p><p>Firstly, the dominant new feature of this next-generation smartphone is the 5.8-inch display that dominates the front panel of the device. This wraparound screen will very much update the iPhone concept, and will undoubtedly make this device the most sought-after of the three new iPhone releases.</p><h3>Face ID</h3><p>As had also been predicted, Apple has dropped the Home button from the iPhone range in favor of a new Face ID system. It doesn&rsquo;t come as a huge surprise, as leaks from a disgruntled employee in the last 48 hours had pretty much revealed this already. However, it was still refreshing to hear this confirmed by the Apple hierarchy, ahead of the final release of the iPhone 10.</p><p>The display is certainly a massive improvement on previous iPhone releases in terms of resolution, delivering 458 pixels per inch. The super retina screen also supports HDR, meaning that the iPhone screen will never have looked so crisp and detailed.</p><p>Apple was keen to emphasize that the new Face ID system is compatible with the Apple Pay mobile payment system, along with any third-party applications that already accept the Touch ID system. Assorted Apple employees demonstrated that accessing the home screen is now achieved by simply swiping upwards. &ldquo;The point of it is to enable an entirely new experience,&rdquo; Phil Schiller, Apple&rsquo;s VP of marketing, asserted.</p><p>According to Apple, the new Face ID system is also 20 times more secure than the existing Touch ID security feature. This is clearly the major motivation for introducing the new technology, in a climate in which mobile security is increasingly sensitive.</p><h3>Animojis</h3><p>Apple also demonstrated so-called &lsquo;animojis&rsquo;; animated emojis that a user controls with their face. These will be made available through the Messages app. Craig Federighi, senior VP of software engineering, successfully demonstrated this features to the assembled audience and masses watching worldwide.</p><h3>Wireless charging and camera</h3><p>The glass-backed smartphone can also be charged wirelessly, with a new AirPower device able to handle multiple devices. Camera features have also been improved in the iPhone X aka iPhone 10, with improved flash, better low-light performance, and portrait lighting for selfies. People are going to be blown away with the selfies you can take,&rdquo; Phil Schiller, Apple&rsquo;s VP of marketing, suggested.</p>', 'iPhone', 2, 0, 0, 0, 0),

Yep, that&#39;s right, no &quot;flat tyre&quot; at the bottom of the screen like the Bradshaw.</p><p>Does the Access Sofie have brains as well as beauty? We&#39;ve been blinding people with the bling from this smartwatch for the last month to find out.</p><h3>Michael Kors Access Sofie: Design</h3><ul><li>42mm stainless steel casing</li><li>Michael Kors branding on button</li><li>IP67 water and dust resistance</li></ul><p>The Michael Kors Access Sofie is a Kors watch through and through. For the fans of the fashion giant, the Sofie won&#39;t disappoint. It is everything you&#39;d expect and more, including waterproofing (that&#39;s the <a href="http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/138727-water-and-dust-ip-ratings-what-do-they-actually-mean" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">IP67 rating</a>bit).</p><p>The Access Sofie brings style and substance in a premium and solid build quality. It has a 42mm stainless steel casing, smaller than the Access Bradshaw, and its display is surrounded with crystals, ensuring this Android Wear device does everything but go unnoticed.</p><p>For some, it will be too much and perhaps still too chunky (despite it being smaller than its predecessor), but we love how versatile the Sofie is. It complements everyday clothing as well as smarter clothing, suiting all occasions perfectly, even black tie. It&#39;s comfortable to wear too.</p><p>To the right of the watch is an MK-etched button which powers on the display, brings you to the main Android Wear app menu and launches Google Assistant - more on that later. It doesn&#39;t twist like the <a href="http://www.pocket-lint.com/review/140428-lg-watch-style-review-subtlety-over-style" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">LG Watch Style</a>&#39;s button, so you&#39;ll need to use your finger to scroll through your options on screen, but it is clean and simple.</p><p>The back of the watch face is plastic to allow for wireless charging via a handy disc, but this is the only element of this watch where you&#39;ll find a slightly cheap look. The rest of the device screams premium with a nice weight to it, just as you would expect from a Kors device.</p><h3>Michael Kors Access Sofie: Display</h3><ul><li>1.19-inch AMOLED touchscreen display</li><li>390 x 390 pixel resolution (463ppi)</li><li>Fully round display, Always On option</li></ul><p>As the Access Sofie is a smartwatch, the traditional Kors face is replaced with an AMOLED touchscreen display. Everything displayed on the screen is clear and crisp, which is what really matters.</p><p>Unlike the Access Bradshaw, the Sofie has no &quot;flat tyre&quot; at the bottom, too, offering a fully round face. We thought the Bradshaw did a fairly good job of hiding the sensor that causes the flat tyre look, but having a fully round screen is certainly preferable.</p><p>Colours are vibrant and punchy, as you expect from an AMOLED display, and the screen is typically responsive. It&#39;s a beautiful display that handles bright, sunny conditions well, with the display automatically adjusting accordingly to ambient light.</p><p>However, there were a couple of occasions during testing when the responsiveness wasn&#39;t perfect or as quick as we would have liked, mainly when saving a watch face to MK Access My Looks - more on that in a minute - but these were rare instances, so nothing to be too concerned about. We would also prefer notifications to appear with a black background rather than the slightly washed-out grey.</p><p>The display offers enough vibrancy even when not on the highest brightness setting, which is great for saving battery life. There is also the option of an Always On display, something the likes of the <a href="http://www.pocket-lint.com/review/142228-apple-watch-series-3-review-a-great-smartwatch-albeit-with-plenty-of-caveats">Apple Watch</a>doesn&#39;t offer. The Always On face is darker and more subtle, switching to monochrome and showing just the time to preserve battery life.&nbsp;</p>', '', 0, 0, 1, 0, 0),

It&#39;s an ambitious device, switching to an 18:9 display and refining the bodywork of the previous device,&nbsp;while looking to right some of those wrongs.</p><p>But somewhere along this road Google hit a bump.&nbsp;</p><h3>What&#39;s new for the Google Pixel 2 XL?</h3><ul><li>157.9 x 76.7 x 7.9mm, 175g</li><li>18:9 aspect display</li><li>Just Black or Black and White colours</li><li>Aluminium body, IP67 protection</li></ul><p>Google has kept a design quirk in the Pixel 2 XL with that split rear that we saw on the original model. It&#39;s reduced on this model - rumoured to be manufactured by LG - leaving only a small section at the rear top that&#39;s glass, with the rest of the body metal.&nbsp;</p><p>The front is all glass, with the surface curving at the edges to flow into the aluminium bodywork. The fit and finish is great, displaying great quality in all directions and coming in two colours: black or black and white. The black version is a little more stealthy, while the black and white version is adorned with an orange power button. Little details matter and this gives the design a lift, although the general theme here seems to be slightly understated.</p><p>This phone is <a href="http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/138727-water-and-dust-ip-ratings-what-do-they-actually-mean" target="_blank">IP67 rated</a>, giving it the water-proofing which it needs to sit in this flagship position: the previous version wasn&#39;t and that was the biggest criticism of the phone. The metal work is also coated for a surface that has some grip: this doesn&#39;t feel like the metal body of the iPhone 7 or HTC 10, it feels distinctly different, which we like, although we&#39;ve already spotted some scuffing around the top edge and we&#39;ve been very careful with this phone so far.&nbsp;</p><p>But let&#39;s talk about size. Measuring 157.9 x 76.7 x 7.9mm, the first thing you might notice is that this phone is larger than it perhaps needs to be. It&#39;s only slightly smaller than the <a href="http://www.pocket-lint.com/review/142231-apple-iphone-8-plus-review-strong-and-steady" target="_blank">iPhone 8 Plus</a> so despite the shift in display aspect (with the aim of giving you a big screen without a big body), the Pixel 2 XL doesn&#39;t really achieve that aim.</p><p>Pitching the size against more formidable competition, it&#39;s noticeably larger than the LG V30 (which has the same 6-inch 18:9) display, so in some regards, the Pixel 2 XL is a little unambitious: it makes a move to a different aspect display while not fully delivering one of the greatest benefits of that design shift, namely, a more compact body.</p><p>One of the things the design allows for is front-facing stereo speakers, although the accommodation of those seems&nbsp;has pushed this phone to be larger than it justifies. The performance from those speakers is good, but only good, so they perhaps don&#39;t justify the space they&#39;re given. They&#39;re no match for HTC BoomSound, lacking the richness and volume of HTC&#39;s solution.</p><p>Other things to note are that the 3.5mm headphone socket is gone, so it&#39;s USB Type-C for audio, or the dongle in the box&nbsp;to use your old headphones. The fingerprint scanner remains on the rear in a sensible place, certainly more practical to use than Samsung&#39;s Galaxy S8 and Note 8 models and we found this perfectly fast to unlock the phone.</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/142376-google-pixel-2-vs-pixel-2-xl-what-s-the-difference" target="_blank">Google Pixel 2 vs Pixel 2 XL: What&#39;s the difference?</a></li></ul><h3>Let&#39;s talk about that display...</h3><ul><li>6-inch OLED, 2880 x 1440 pixel resolution, 538ppi</li><li>18:9 aspect</li></ul><p>We&#39;re going to focus on the display next, because we think it&#39;s worth a few more words than normal. As we&#39;ve already detailed, the Pixel 2 XL moves to a new display aspect, following the likes of the <a href="http://www.pocket-lint.com/review/140644-samsung-galaxy-s8-review-the-best-android-phone-bar-none" target="_blank">Samsung Galaxy S8+</a>, <a href="http://www.pocket-lint.com/review/142084-lg-v30-preview-a-flagship-that-s-not-just-for-creatives" target="_blank">LG V30</a>, and latterly the <a href="http://www.pocket-lint.com/review/142227-apple-iphone-x-preview-the-future-of-apple-smartphones" target="_blank">Apple iPhone X</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>It is, we suspect, the same panel that&#39;s used in the LG V30, given that it&#39;s referred to as p-OLED (which LG tends to use as Samsung dominates the AMOLED nomenclature) and the exact same size and resolution as the LG V30. It couldn&#39;t look more different, however.&nbsp;</p><p>The thing that we all expect from OLED displays is that they give nice deep blacks but also vibrancy and pop. It is vibrancy and pop that the Pixel 2 XL doesn&#39;t have. This display looks pretty flat and lifeless compared to any number of existing devices. It doesn&#39;t look as good as the old <a href="http://www.pocket-lint.com/review/139043-google-pixel-xl-review-android-s-new-heavyweight-champion" target="_blank">Pixel XL</a>, the iPhone 8 or the LG V30.

Dell proved that you could have a full-size, 13-inch display in a computer that&rsquo;s as compact and portable as an 11-inch model. Nearly every other laptop maker has followed down this path, and now there are a lot of laptop options with trim bezels and small footprints.</p><p>In the years since this design debuted, Dell has updated the XPS 13 numerous times, bestowing it with processor upgrades, adding new port types, and removing others. It even extended the design to a larger model, the beefy XPS 15, which packs a very powerful computer into a surprisingly portable package, and a 2-in-1 convertible take.</p><p>But what Dell hasn&rsquo;t done is address many of the flaws of the original XPS 13. I&rsquo;ve been using the latest model, which starts at $799 and comes equipped with Intel&rsquo;s eighth-generation processors. By most accounts, it&rsquo;s a great computer. But it also feels like a swan song for this design, which is perhaps ready to be put out to pasture.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s start with the good: even though Dell&rsquo;s tricks of slimming down the display bezels have been copied countless times over, the XPS 13 is still one of the most compact computers you can buy. It makes my everyday driver, the Surface Laptop, feel like a surfboard at times. It takes up such little space in my bag that I almost feel like my bag is bigger than it actually is.</p><p>The model I&rsquo;ve been using has a bright, high-resolution (3200 x 1800) touchscreen display, a fantastic keyboard that&rsquo;s a joy to type on, and a Windows Precision trackpad that&rsquo;s smooth and easy to use. To the left of the trackpad is a fingerprint scanner that makes logging in quick and painless (if not quite as easy as the face-scanning systems other laptops offer).</p><p>Despite the small size, the XPS 13 still fits in two full-size USB ports, plus a USB Type-C Thunderbolt 3 port. There&rsquo;s even a full-size SD card slot, which is such a rarity on computers of this size in 2017 that I almost wonder if it&rsquo;s a mistake. (It&rsquo;s not, and it&rsquo;s wonderful.) Perhaps my favorite part is the battery meter on the left side that lets you check the status when the computer&rsquo;s lid is closed.</p><p>Inside, Intel&rsquo;s eighth-generation Core i7 processor (paired with 16GB of RAM in my test unit) is both powerful and power efficient. Just like we saw with the similarly equipped Yoga 920 from Lenovo, this XPS 13 can handle basically any task I have with ease, and does so quietly and coolly. It&rsquo;s also able to last through an entire eight- to 10-hour workday with ease, which, while a far cry from the &ldquo;up to 22 hours of continuous use&rdquo; that Dell claims, is still good enough for me.</p>', '', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0),

And now, Paste is finally making its way to the platform people know FiftyThree for best: the iPad and iPhone.</p><aside><br>In many ways, Paste has always felt like it should have an iOS app. The entire app is built around a simple UI for editing slides meant to let users focus on content instead of fiddling with fonts and layouts, with a robust drag-and-drop function for automatically generating content out of images, links, and videos. Add in the Facebook-like reactions and commenting functions that are already a major part of the app, and a mobile version is a natural fit. You can leave those comments directly on a slide in Paste and have them pop up in a Slack room, as well as assign team members from Slack to work on specific slides.</aside><p><br></p><p>I&rsquo;ve been able to try out the mobile versions of Paste, and while the iPhone version is probably still best-suited for just viewing slides and leaving feedback for other team members, the iPad version &mdash; thanks to iOS 11&rsquo;s drag-and-drop features &mdash; is just as good as the desktop app.</p><p>Paste is free to try for a limited time, and costs $8 per month per user, so it&rsquo;s still likely going to remain an enterprise-focused service for now. And while Paste does look very nice, if you&rsquo;re team isn&rsquo;t running everything in Slack, it&rsquo;s somewhat harder to justify the cost for what is ultimately a very minimalist version of Google Slides.</p><p>It would also be nice to see an Android version of Paste somewhere in the future, too.

Demanding that my phone turn on and off the lights started feeling weird to say aloud, which got me to wondering: was I being rude to my smartphone?&nbsp;</p><p>To be clear, this isn&rsquo;t some kind of &ldquo;Be nice to Alexa or the robots will kill you during the inevitable uprising&rdquo; thing. I know very well that Siri and Cortana are just a bundle of voice recognition software and algorithms, and that they&rsquo;ll work just as well if I ask them to &ldquo;Tell me the weather report, please&rdquo; or just bark out a command for the forecast. And as for saying thank you, given that the speakers have (in theory) shut off from active listening by that point of the query process, it&rsquo;s unlikely that my Echo can even here me saying it.&nbsp;</p><section><section><p>Or, as various people have made the argument to me, would you say &ldquo;please&rdquo; to a toaster or &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; to an ATM?&nbsp;</p><p>But here&rsquo;s the thing. I don&rsquo;t talk aloud to an ATM or toaster. And I do when I&rsquo;m asking Siri to turn on the lights or set an alarm, in the same natural language that I use in day-to-day life. It doesn&rsquo;t matter that an Echo can&rsquo;t hear or understand it &mdash; it matters that you say it. At what point does my rudeness to smart assistants start to bleed into my normal speech patterns? If I get used to asking Alexa to turn on the lights without saying please, will I still do the same when I ask my roommate that&rsquo;s walking by? I&rsquo;m polite to my smart assistants because I want to be polite to people too, and reinforcing rude habits seems like a bad idea.&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe I&rsquo;m totally crazy here. When I polled people on Twitter, it seemed that most people aren&rsquo;t polite to their digital assistants, which again, is totally fine since they really can&rsquo;t tell the difference.

The smartphone features slim bezels all around the display to provide an 18:9 aspect ratio. The company is expected to continue the full-screen design with the LG G7 next year, and we are now hearing that the upcoming flagship could also sport an advanced iris scanner as well.</p><p>A patent recently surfaced <a href="https://nl.letsgodigital.org/smartphones/lg-g7-irisscanner/" target="_blank">via&nbsp;</a>LetsGoDigital gives us a look at an iris scanning technology that seems to do more than just unlock the phone. As per the report, the technology will also help users protect sensitive information stored in the phone. What this means is that the iris scanning sensors will open certain sensitive apps only if it recognises you as the owner of the phone. The reports notes that the advanced iris scanner will register changes in the iris size and will set up a light screen or dark screen depending on how much light gets to it.</p><p>While iris scanners work with infrared light, LG has reportedly developed a camera which can switch from an infrared to a regular one. This could possibly reduce the number of sensor needed for the biometric technology, which could mean even smaller bezels on the top for the G7.</p><p>Way back in May, rumours about LG&#39;s next flagship started rolling with reports that the G7 could sport Qualcomm&#39;s latest Snapdragon 845 processor. While the next-gen chipset is expected to power most flagship Android devices next year, it isn&#39;t entirely sure that the G7 will be one of them. To recall, LG decided to skip the Snapdragon 835 SoC this year and instead went with the older 821 chip for the LG G6.</p><p>While fans do expect LG to not make a similar mistake with the G7 next year, it is possible that the upcoming flagship could go with the current Snapdragon 835 SoC, if the company plans to launch the device as early as CES 2018 in January, as some recent reports have suggested. The company in recent years has been unveiling its flagships ahead of its competition, especially Samsung, to get a one up on them, but at the risk of outdated hardware.

After many months and questions on whether Apple would keep its promise, Prime Video has finally arrived on Apple TV and can be downloaded via the App Store in tvOS.</p><p>India Today Tech can confirm this via the latest version of Amazon Prime Video app on iOS (version 5.0), which details that the streaming service can be viewed on Apple TV (3rd generation and later) by downloading the standalone tvOS app. As we didn&#39;t have access to an Apple TV at the time of writing, we can not confirm whether it has rolled out officially. However, since it has been mentioned in the latest version of the iOS app, it&#39;s safe to assume that the Cupertino giant has pushed out the streaming service for its Apple TV.</p><p>For the uninitiated, Amazon Prime Video is a video streaming service similar to Netflix and Hotstar. While the latter two have been available for Apple TV users, Prime Video had been held back for a long time due to Apple&#39;s dispute with Amazon after the e-commerce platform refused to sell Apple TV units on its platform. At WWDC 2017, Apple announced that Prime Video would roll out for Apple TV this year and many had presumed it would be during the summer.

And I did it all without ever leaving a tiny warehouse in Glendale, California.</p><p>What I experienced was <em>Star Wars: Secrets of the Empire</em>, the much-anticipated collaboration between virtual reality park designers The Void and ILMxLAB, the immersive entertainment wing of Lucasfilm and Industrial Light &amp; Magic. From the moment the companies announced they were <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/3/16084460/star-wars-secrets-of-the-empire-disney-the-void-virtual-reality">working together on a <em>Star Wars</em>-based VR adventure</a>, with locations opening in both California and Florida, expectations have been high. In <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/29/12060066/ghostbusters-dimension-the-void-times-square-madame-tussauds-vr">projects like<em>Ghostbusters: Dimension</em></a>, The Void has demonstrated that its combination of free-roaming VR and physical mazes offer a unique form of entertainment, while xLAB has been breaking new emotional and narrative ground with pieces like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/8/15941596/carne-y-arena-alejandro-inarritu-virtual-reality-installation-border">Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu&rsquo;s museum installation <em>Carne y Arena</em></a>. And then there&rsquo;s that whole <em>Star Wars</em> element &mdash; with <em>Secrets of the Empire</em> opening just as fans hit peak hype for Rian Johnson&rsquo;s <em>The Last Jedi</em>.</p><p>Having gone through a prototype version of the experience in that Glendale warehouse, it&rsquo;s clear that this experience does more than just deliver on those lofty expectations. For mainstream audiences, <em>Star Wars: Secrets of the Empire</em> may be the first time virtual reality actually delivers on the Holodeck-esque potential it&rsquo;s been promising all along.</p><p><em>Secrets of the Empire</em> starts with a briefing. Groups of up to four guests are shown a video from <em>Rogue One</em>&rsquo;s Cassian Andor (Diego Luna). There&rsquo;s a piece of Imperial cargo that&rsquo;s been brought to the planet Mustafar, he says, and while he was originally going to retrieve it, he&rsquo;s now under attack. It&rsquo;s up to the group of guests to go undercover as stormtroopers and get the job done. From there, audience members suit up with a custom head-mounted display, lightweight backpack computer, and a haptic vest, and step into an adjoining room. Pull down the headset, and the real world melts away: where other participants were a moment ago, stormtroopers now stand.</p><p>The storyline is exactly what any <em>Star Wars</em>fan would hope for: the group of participants infiltrate the base, get into some skirmishes, and after a couple of lucky escapes (and a big surprise), make their way out having more or less accomplished the mission. But what The Void does well is create the illusion of truly being in a virtual world by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/1/12058614/vr-theme-parks-disney-six-flags-the-void-ghostbusters-virtual-reality">pairing physical sets, props, and sensations with the VR visuals</a>. <em>Secrets of the Empire</em> uses that combination to ground the experience right from the beginning. As I stepped into a transport, K-2SO (Alan Tudyk, also reprising his role) suggested I sit down on the ship&rsquo;s bench &mdash; and sure enough, there was a physical bench waiting for me when I did. When I waved my hands in front of my face, there they were, clad in the white-and-black gloves of a stormtrooper. Moments later, when I stood on a skiff approaching the Imperial facility, I felt the heat from the lava below, while the smoky smell of Mustafar&rsquo;s atmosphere filled my nostrils. Later, when engaged in a firefight with stormtroopers, I felt a sharp haptic buzz whenever I caught a stray blaster bolt &mdash; not painful, but not exactly pleasant, either.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a tremendous amount of fun just in the pure discovery of the experience: the realization that I could chatter along with the people I was playing with (&ldquo;I have a bad feeling about this&rdquo;), or that there was a Han Solo-esque workaround to a puzzle that I couldn&rsquo;t crack. But breaking it down into those kind of singular moments seems reductive, because more than anything else, <em>Secrets of the Empire</em> legitimately feels like starring in a <em>Star Wars</em> movie or TV show of your very own. Part of that is the length. From the briefing to the moment you remove the gear at the end, the experience runs roughly 30 minutes, so there&rsquo;s some heft to it. Another component is the tactile reality that The Void creates, paired with the sense of independence that comes from being able to walk around a virtual location without any perceived restrictions or limitations. The Void uses <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/8/1/12344702/siggraph-virtual-reality-redirected-walking-unlimited-corridor">design sleight of hand and misdirection</a> to guide guests through relatively small physical spaces that feel massive and epic in the virtual world. It&rsquo;s an illusion, but an incredibly effective one that creates a compelling sense of autonomy and agency.</p><p>But even that can only get you so far. <em>Star Wars</em> is a universe that&rsquo;s ultimately defined by that <em>kinds</em> of stories it tells. And whether I was quickly ducking into a blasted-open passageway, furiously trading blaster fire with a group of stormtroopers above me, or facing what seemed like certain doom at the climax of the piece, <em>Secrets of the Empire</em> nailed the feeling of being inside the universe completely.</p><p>&ldquo;The important thing was, how can I bring a real person into the <em>Star Wars</em> universe and have them be a part of the story, but also be able to make their own kind of story within ours,&rdquo; Lucasfilm Story Group executive and xLAB content strategist Diana Williams tells me. The events of <em>Secrets of the Empire</em> are canon in the larger universe, and while the narrative is fixed, it&rsquo;s the nature of the medium that every individual who goes through will have their own unique experience based on what they do, how they react, and who they go in with. It creates a unique opportunity for replayability &mdash; even at $29.95 per ticket &mdash; with guests able to experience different elements or even take on different duties in certain scenes depending on how aggressively they choose to play.</p><p>Initially, <em>Secrets of the Empire</em> will open in two standalone locations. The first will be at Disney Springs at Walt Disney World starting on December 16th, which will be capable of serving around a thousand guests per day across two different stages. A single-stage location will then open at the Disneyland-adjacent Downtown Disney complex in California on January 5th. But The Void will also be opening a two-stage pop-up at the Westfield mall in London for a 12-week run on December 16th, with the location later moving to a different Westfield for subsequent 12-week runs. That&rsquo;s aside from future locations that The Void CEO Cliff Plumer says are also on the way.</p><p>&ldquo;We&#39;ll be announcing more locations that are opening up, but I always say, I like to think of us almost like a Cirque de Soleil,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;There&#39;s those flagship locations, and then we have traveling shows.&rdquo;</p><p>The Void currently has locations in Toronto, Utah, and New York, and briefly opened a center in Dubai. But it&rsquo;s easy to see how the high-profile nature of the <em>Star Wars</em> partnership, together with the pop-up strategy, will expose more people than ever to its unique flavor of virtual reality. It&rsquo;s coming at a crucial time. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/11/16458806/oculus-rift-htc-vive-vr-hype-game-developers">hype wave from the launch of at-home VR dissipated</a> some time ago, and the industry focus has increasingly turned toward location-based solutions like the IMAX VR arcades that the company is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/17/16669894/imax-vr-scotiabank-theatre-toronto">currently piloting at movie theaters</a>. But even those are often just souped-up versions of experiences that are already available to VR users at home. The Void, on the other hand, is poised to deliver on the kind of active, full-bodied experience that has largely been the ideal of VR, even if it&rsquo;s rarely been reached.</p><p>That&rsquo;s not to say <em>Star Wars: Secrets of the Empire</em> is flawless, by any means. I found the hand tracking to be inconsistent, with my virtual hands appearing smoothly at some moments, while remaining stubbornly nonexistent at others. In a scene that required me to hit a number of buttons in sequence in order to escape a room, the tracking between the physical and the digital seemed so misaligned that I was unable to solve the puzzle altogether.

YouTube&rsquo;s reasoning for introducing them is not unlike what we&rsquo;ve heard from Snap and Instagram: people want a way to share content without having to go the full mile and publish a traditional YouTube video. Reels are being tested among a small group of the site&rsquo;s creators, and the company isn&rsquo;t yet saying when this &ldquo;new format&rdquo; will be more widely rolled out.</p><p>YouTube is diverging from the typical Stories formula in several ways.

That&rsquo;s different from Instagram and Snapchat, where your temporary posts are part of one, centralized story.</p><p><em>TechCrunch</em> says the process of making Reels is as follows: you shoot &ldquo;a few quick mobile videos of up to 30 seconds each&rdquo; and can spruce them up with the usual mix of filters or by adding music and text. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re also bringing creator-focused features like linking to YouTube videos and YouTube-y stickers,&rdquo; <a href="https://youtube-creators.googleblog.com/2017/11/expanding-community-on-youtube.html">YouTube&rsquo;s Roy Livne said</a> in a blog post.</p><p>YouTube giving into the Stories trend comes alongside the hire of Todd Sherman, who <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/toddsherman">previously worked as lead product manager</a>on Snapchat&rsquo;s trend-setting version of the feature.

Called <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/12/introducing-messenger-kids-a-new-app-for-families-to-connect/">Messenger Kids</a>, the new app does not require a Facebook account &mdash; due to federal law, users under the age of 13 cannot legally sign up for Facebook. Rather, parents are able to manage a child&rsquo;s Messenger Kids app from their Facebook account, controlling which friends and family members the child is able to contact. Facebook is launching the app today in preview with a limited rollout on iOS.</p><p>Facebook says it&rsquo;s going to great lengths to make sure the app does not come off as exploitative. &ldquo;There are no ads in Messenger Kids and your child&#39;s information isn&#39;t used for ads. It is free to download and there are no in-app purchases,&rdquo; the company <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/12/introducing-messenger-kids-a-new-app-for-families-to-connect/">writes in a blog post</a>. Facebook says Messenger Kids is also designed to be compliant with the Children&#39;s Online Privacy and Protection Act, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Online_Privacy_Protection_Act">COPPA</a>. That&rsquo;s the federal law that protects underage children from exploitation online, and it&rsquo;s the reason so many online services require children be 13 years of age or older in order to sign up. Facebook says the new app is only available in the US, with plans to expand its availability beyond iOS to the Amazon App Store and Google Play Store in the coming months.</p><p>Messenger Kids is primarily designed to offer video and text chat along with the types of playful masks and filters, originally popularized by Snapchat, that are now prevalent across Facebook&rsquo;s many messaging products. Facebook says there is a &ldquo;library of kid-appropriate and specially chosen GIFs, frames, stickers, masks and drawing tools lets them decorate content and express their personalities.&rdquo; The app also gives parents the ability to control a child&rsquo;s contact list, while a more spartan home screen shows pre-approved friends that are online and preexisting one-on-one chats and group threads.</p><p>To use the app, parents must download it from the App Store and then authenticate it with their Facebook user name and password. Only then can an account be created for a child, with the process requiring only a name for the profile. Contacts are added through an &ldquo;Explore&rdquo; section of the app that should let parents search and find other contacts. Users with existing Facebook accounts, like relatives, can create Messenger Kids accounts to chat with the children, with parents having control over which contacts are approved and show up as online when a child uses the app.</p><p>While on the surface Messenger Kids seems relatively innocuous, the underlying motive here cannot go unmentioned. Kids today have at their disposal a number of methods that allow them to communicate with friends and relatives, be it a traditional phone call, an email message, or perhaps even a text, if they have their own cell phone. What children don&rsquo;t have access to is social networks like Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, and YouTube. That because&rsquo;s of laws like COPPA, implemented because lawmakers determined that, without robust protections, it&rsquo;s reasonable to think children will be exploited online by predators, advertisers, and others.</p><p>Now Facebook is creating a pipeline for children to become regular users of its products, starting as young as six years old, by claiming to offer an alternative better than what it exists today.</p><p>Facebook seems to recognize how this will all look to the public, and it&rsquo;s using a clever defense to defect criticism. In a separate blog post titled, &ldquo;Hard Questions,&rdquo; Facebook&rsquo;s Public Policy Director Antigone Davis writes, &ldquo;Children today are online earlier and earlier. They use family-shared devices &mdash; and many, as young as six or seven years old, even have their own.&rdquo;</p><p>She goes on to point out that &ldquo;research shows that kids are using apps that are intended for teens and adults.&rdquo; Davis says Facebook collaborated with National PTA on a study showing observing 1,200 American parents of children under the age of 13, with three out of every five parents saying kids under 13 are already using messaging apps, while 81 percent say their kids stated using social media apps as early as eight. So Facebook&rsquo;s pitch to parents is pretty much: use Messenger Kids, because at the very least you can control what your child does with our app.</p><p>Employees of the company, and those who created this product, may have good intentions, and it&rsquo;s clear Facebook is following the legal protocols to prevent abuse. But it&rsquo;s still worth pointing out that Facebook is going after the next generation of users by targeting children. It&rsquo;s not far-fetched to assume that child users of Messenger Kids will be more likely to want a Facebook account, and that Facebook will make it easier in the future to migrate a child&rsquo;s Messenger Kids account over to the main app.</p><p>The social network has for years used strategic acquisitions and developed copycat products to prevent its user base from fleeing to competitors and to capture younger users. Look at its purchases of Instagram and WhatsApp, its extensive moves to kill Snapchat, and its in-progress cloning of Houseparty, a group messaging app that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/2017/9/13/16301696/facebook-standalone-video-chat-app-bonfire">informed Facebook&rsquo;s Bonfire</a>.

Datally will show which apps are using data the most and at what times your data is getting used up; it&rsquo;ll also recommend ways to cut down data usage based on your own activity and suggest nearby Wi-Fi networks for you to connect to.</p><p>More importantly, there&rsquo;s a big button at the top of the app that lets you stop all background data usage, so only the app that&rsquo;s actively onscreen can use mobile data. A chat-head style bubble will also pop up to let you know how much data your currently running app is using up. And if you don&rsquo;t want to block every single app from using background data, Datally will let you go in and control data usage on an app by app basis, too.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re a longtime Android user, Datally might not sound all that exciting. Nearly all of the app&rsquo;s functions are already built into Android directly. But those features are hidden inside the settings menu, and they aren&rsquo;t spelled out quite as neatly as they appear to be inside Datally.

It&rsquo;s also why Datally takes up a tiny 6MB of space.</p><p>Josh Woodward, the product manager overseeing Datally, says the idea for the app came from seeing the lengths that people go to preserve data, particularly in countries where mobile plans remain relatively expensive. In Delhi, Lagos, and Buenos Aires, Woodard said his team saw people who would keep their phone on airplane mode at all times to prevent data usage. When they wanted to check their notifications, they&rsquo;d turn airplane mode off, let all the info rush in, and then turn airplane mode back on while they looked over the new information.</p><p>&ldquo;A bunch of us on the team spent a lot of time on long flights observing people in their homes, bus stations, classrooms, and kept seeing this airplane mode behavior,&rdquo; Woodward told <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>Google has been testing Datally in the Philippines since this summer. The company says it&rsquo;s already hit over 500,000 users and that it&rsquo;s been able to save people, on average, 30 percent of their data. As of today, the app is being released to the rest of the world and is available to any phone running Android 5.0 or higher.</p><p>Obviously, if you can afford to use the extra data, you probably won&rsquo;t want to use this app. Cutting off background data use will hurt your overall phone experience, as not only will apps not refresh content in the background, but apps won&rsquo;t send you push notifications either (which means you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to chat with someone over anything but SMS). But if you&rsquo;re constantly bumping up against your data cap, Datally seems like an easy way to start figuring out where the problem is.</p>', 'Google,new Android app,apps,wasting your data', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),

As expected, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/31/15711334/microsoft-windows-10-arm-qualcomm-pcs-asus-hp-lenovo">HP, Lenovo, and Asus are the manufacturers</a> creating these new laptops that include a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor. The first devices are similar to 2-in-1 tablet / laptops we&rsquo;ve seen with Intel-based processors in them, but they differ primarily because of the version of Windows 10 and Qualcomm processor that&rsquo;s powering them.</p><p>Microsoft has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/7/13866936/microsoft-windows-10-arm-desktop-apps-support-qualcomm">previously shown Photoshop running on an ARM version of Windows 10</a>, and the company has developed a special emulator to run traditional x86 apps on these new devices. These devices look and feel like normal laptops, and will run most of the software you&rsquo;d expect to see on a laptop. HP and Asus are announcing their devices today, and Lenovo is expected to follow in the coming weeks.</p><p>The obvious question is why do these devices even exist? Microsoft has worked with Qualcomm to create these &ldquo;always-on&rdquo; PCs so that they&rsquo;re always connected to LTE connections, and work more like an iPad than a traditional Windows laptop. That means you open the laptop up and it should instantly resume, or you close the lid and never have to worry about the battery draining. These devices should have battery benefits and the type of LTE connectivity that we haven&rsquo;t seen regularly in Windows laptops.</p><p>HP and Asus&rsquo; devices will include Windows 10 S, designed to only run apps from the Windows Store, but users will be able to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro free of charge (for now) to get access to the full desktop apps. Microsoft has natively compiled Windows 10 to run on ARM chipsets, so all Windows processes, Edge, and the shell all run natively without emulation. Microsoft has also looked at the top third-party desktop applications and natively recompiled a set of system DLLs that they rely on to ensure performance is solid.</p><p>Microsoft&rsquo;s emulation work does mean that you&rsquo;ll be able to download most 32-bit exe files from the web and install them on ARM-powered laptops. There are a few exceptions, though. 64-bit Windows apps aren&rsquo;t supported yet (developers will be able to recompile them in the future), and Microsoft isn&rsquo;t supporting apps that use kernel mode drivers. That means most third-party antivirus software won&rsquo;t be compatible, and the vast majority of games that use anti-cheat software will also not work correctly.</p><p>Everything else <em>should</em> run just fine, including apps like Photoshop, Office, and Chrome. Performance is obviously still the big question around these devices vs. Intel-based ones, but the idea is that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/18/16495010/microsoft-windows-10-arm-laptops-battery-life">all-day battery life</a> and not having to charge your device regularly might make up for a slight hit to performance. The first devices should run for around 20&ndash;22 hours of active use, but if those estimates are anything like what we see with Intel-based laptops then the reality could be a lot less. We&rsquo;ll be testing them heavily to find out.</p>', 'Microsoft,battery life,Windows 10 PCs,ARM-powered ', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),

(122, 'Instagram is testing Direct, a standalone messaging app that replaces the current inbox', 'Kishan Sheth', '11-12-2017', 11, '125.jpg', '<p>Instagram is testing a standalone app for private messages called Direct, a first step toward possibly toward removing messaging features from the core app. Direct, which opens to the camera in the same way Snapchat does, will become available on Android and iOS today in six countries: Chile, Israel, Italy, Portugal, Turkey, and Uruguay. If you install Direct, the inbox disappears from the Instagram app and can only be accessed in the messaging app. If Instagram introduces Direct globally &mdash; it currently has no timeline for doing so &mdash; the move could give parent company Facebook a third popular messaging tool alongside Messenger and WhatsApp.</p><p>Although it is officially only a test, Instagram&rsquo;s rationale for building Direct app is that private messaging can never be a best-in-class experience when it lives inside an app meant for broadcasting publicly. &ldquo;We want Instagram to be a place for all of your moments, and private sharing with close friends is an important part of that,&rdquo; Hemal Shah, an Instagram product manager, told me. &ldquo;Direct has grown within Instagram over the past four years, but we can make it even better if it stands on its own. We can push the boundaries to create the fastest and most creative space for private sharing when Direct is a camera-first, standalone app.&rdquo;</p><p>If that sounds familiar, it&rsquo;s because Facebook has undertake a transition like this before. In 2014, the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/4/9/5598440/facebook-will-turn-off-messaging-in-its-mobile-app-forcing-you-to-download-messenger">shut off messaging inside the flagship app</a>, forcing users to download Messenger. &ldquo;On mobile, each app can only focus on doing one thing well,&rdquo; CEO Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/11/6/7170791/mark-zuckerberg-finally-explains-why-he-forced-you-to-download-the">said at the time</a>. &ldquo;Asking folks to install another app is a short term painful thing, but if we wanted to focus on serving this [use case] well, we had to build a dedicated and focused experience.&rdquo;</p><p>Direct was built according to similar logic. While direct messaging was originally an afterthought in Instagram, after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/1/9236553/instagram-direct-messaging-update">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/11/15250766/instagram-direct-ephemeral-messaging-update">redesigns</a> it had accumulated 375 million monthly users by April of this year, the company says. Its rise has coincided with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/01/instagram-whatsapp-vs-snapchat/">growth of Instagram stories</a>, which encourage users to fire back quick replies to friends&rsquo; messages by adding a &ldquo;send message&rdquo; box underneath each one.</p><figure><span data-original="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9824541/ImageJoiner_2017_12_06_at_3.33.50_PM.jpg"><img data-fr-image-pasted="true" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YKpPsmrinRRLV7bg5VCRjc50URc=/1000x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9824541/ImageJoiner_2017_12_06_at_3.33.50_PM.jpg" alt="" data-chorus-optimize-field="main_image" data-cid="site/dynamic_size_image-1513007681_1483_4645" data-cdata="{&quot;asset_id&quot;:9824541,&quot;ratio&quot;:&quot;*&quot;}" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></span></figure><p>Now Instagram will see whether its tools for private messages can thrive on their own. There is reason to believe that they will: messaging apps have <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-messaging-app-report-2015-11">more aggregate users than social networks do</a>, and some have speculated that growing cultural tensions are pushing more conversations from public forums to private groups. If messaging becomes a large, pseudo-independent pillar of Instagram, it could further entrench the app in the lives of its users while opening up significant new business opportunities.</p><p>In its current, experimental state, there is little in Direct you won&rsquo;t currently find in Instagram. The app consists of just three screens. Like Snapchat, it opens to the camera, in an effort to get you in the habit of regularly sharing. (You don&rsquo;t have to take a photo, though; you can also pull down to reveal a screen that lets you type your message.) To the left of the camera is a profile screen that lets you access settings, switch accounts, and navigate to various corners of Instagram. To the right is your inbox of messages. That&rsquo;s the whole app.</p><p>Still, there are some nice touches. Designers built what might be the niftiest app transition I&rsquo;ve ever seen: If you start swiping to the right of the Direct inbox, an Instagram logo pops begins to peak out from the side of the app. Swipe all the way to the right and Direct will open Instagram. Similarly, you can swipe right in Instagram to reveal the Direct logo &mdash; a modified version of the paper-plane logo Instagram has long used for messages &mdash; and completing your swipe will take you back to Direct.</p><p>The other novelty to be found in the test app is four exclusive filters, all of which I wish were available in the Instagram app. One filter bleeps you at random while blurring your mouth, which you&rsquo;ll appreciate if you&rsquo;ve ever enjoyed Jimmy Kimmel&rsquo;s <a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/jimmy-kimmel-live/video/unnecessary-censorship">unnecessary censorship videos</a>. Another filter creates a live cut-out of your mouth and superimposes it over your actual mouth, making you look like an insane clown. A third filter creates an infinite video loop zooming in on your open mouth as multiple versions of your head swirl around you.</p><p>If there&rsquo;s a down side to Direct, it&rsquo;s that getting the full Instagram experience will now require users to shuttle back and forth between apps. This may feel particularly acute for people who start a lot of chats from the stories feed (this is my own most common use of Instagram messages). In my experience, using a brand-new iPhone X, navigating between apps was all but seamless. I&rsquo;ll be curious to see how it looks on older model phones, and in countries where data connections may be less reliable.</p><p>When Facebook split Messenger from the main app, it drew an outcry from users, who pelted it with <a href="http://mashable.com/2014/08/08/facebook-messenger-bad-reviews/#fpnC58z1nsqw">one-star reviews</a>. Today, the app has <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2017/09/14/facebook-messenger-passes-1-3-billion-monthly-active-users/">1.3 billion monthly users</a> &mdash; up from 500 million the year that it split &mdash; and yet its rating has risen to just three stars on iOS. (Instagram has a five-star rating.)</p><p>One conclusion a company might draw from this experience is that while some users will complain about having to download a second app, the improved experience will help the overall audience grow much larger. And yet I can&rsquo;t imagine the product team at Instagram will be satisfied with a three-star rating for Direct. And so I think there&rsquo;s a second, equally important lesson to take from Messenger&rsquo;s experience.</p><p>It&rsquo;s hard to remember now, but Messenger was once as fast and simple as Direct is today. It was only once it spun out on its own that it became the overstuffed junk drawer it is today: a bewildering combination of private messages, group chats, ephemeral stories, gaming, customer service bots, payments, and phone calls. The challenge for Instagram is to expand Direct&rsquo;s feature set while retaining the simplicity that made it attractive in the first place.</p>', 'Instagram,messaging app', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),

So, if you take a picture of some food, Snapchat will suggest filters with slogans like &ldquo;get in my belly&rdquo; and &ldquo;what diet?&rdquo;</p><p>Snap, the company behind Snapchat, <a href="http://mashable.com/2017/11/26/snapchat-new-filters-based-on-what-youre-snapping-pets/#00du.mLqMOOl">confirmed to <em>Mashable</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>that the filters had started rolling out to users last week, but it didn&rsquo;t provide an exhaustive list of what objects trigger the mechanism. Pets, food, and holiday destinations like beaches all seem to return specific filters, but presumably, Snap will be adding new categories as it goes along. You can test out the filters yourself just by snapping pictures of relevant photos you&rsquo;ve found online. The filters are available in the normal carousel, accessed by swiping left and right.</p><p>This isn&rsquo;t actually the first time Snap has integrated object recognition into its app: the company already uses this feature to let people search for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/31/15139330/snapchat-search-stories-release-update">certain objects and events in stories</a>.

Talking about processor is complex because processors are complex. It is even more difficult to define what they do and how they help the user experience for smartphone users. In comparison, it is easier to talk about the next-generation smartphone cameras, or design, or the screens. Yet, it is easy to see that almost everything that happens on a phone is defined by processors. And that is why something like Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 is important. This is the processor that is going to define premium Android smartphone experience that device will bring to users.</p><p>Given how important is the<a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/technology/story/snapdragon-845-details-ai-faster-better-camera-security-vault/1/1104944.html" target="_blank"><strong>&nbsp;Snapdragon 845</strong></a> , it only makes sense to dive a little deeper into what Qualcomm has announced. Instead of talking about pure performance or the benchmarks, Qualcomm is talking about what the Snapdragon 845 can do when it comes to the real-world and how people use their phones.</p><p>As we go forward, closer to 2018, more details about the Snapdragon 845 will come out as companies announce phones that use it. But for now, here is the Snapdragon 845 summary and what it will do to high-end phones. All in bite-size 10 points.</p><ol><li><p>The Snapdragon 845 is the next-gen processor from Qualcomm. It will power phones like the OnePlus6, Xiaomi Mi 7, Samsung Galaxy S9 and Pixel 3 smartphones in 2018. The processor has 4 high-performance customised A75 cores with top speed of up to 2.8Ghz. It also has additional 4 power-efficient cores based on customised A55 cores that run at a the speed of up to 1.8Ghz. It also has, for the first time, L3 cache of 2MB and system cache of 3GB.</p></li><li><p>The Snapdragon 845 offers up to 25 per cent performance advantage over the Snapdragon 835 for general processing. In low power mode, the phone offers 15 per cent more performance. And in graphics and gaming performance, it offers up to 30 per cent more performance.</p></li><li><p>The Snapdragon 845 is made by Samsung using 10nm LLP process, which is the second generation of the 10nm process. May be this is why there are rumours that the first shipment of the Snapdragon 845 is going to go to Samsung for use in the Galaxy S9.</p></li><li><p>The Snapdragon 845, according to Qualcomm, is going to significantly improve the camera performance in phones. The devices that use the Snapdragon 845 will be able to score more than 100 points in DxO benchmarks. The current phone with top DxO points in Pixel 2 that has a score of 98 points. This the Snapdragon 845 does with Spectra 280 ISP, a dedicated hardware processor for camera work.</p></li><li><p>The Snapdragon 845 also improves video recording. It will offer slow-mo mode of up to 480FPS for 720P videos. For the 4K videos, it will allow recording in HDR with 60FPS. Qualcomm says that the Snapdragon 845 enables Hollywood-class recording.</p></li><li><p>The Snapdragon 845 comes with the &quot;security vault&quot; that is a hardware-based security solution for on-device encryption. This will keep the sensitive data such as fingerprint data or passwords encrypted and on phone. This actually sounds like the hardware-based security vault in the iPhones so it&#39;s good to see it coming to Android phones.</p></li><li><p>The Snapdragon 845 focuses a lot on improving the VR and the AI performance. With the new processor, Qualcomm has also announces XR (eXtended reality) framework. It is VR aka virtual reality in more regular sense. As far as AI is concerned, Qualcomm says that the Snapdragon 845 offers almost 300 per cent improvement in AI-related performance.</p></li><li><p>The Snapdragon 845 s also more power efficient and will result in phones that offer more battery life. How much? This is something Qualcomm has not revealed. But what it has revealed so far is that the Snapdragon comes with the Qualcomm Quick Charge 4+ that promise 50 per cent battery charging in 15 minutes on average. So basically very fast charging.</p></li><li><p>With new X20 LTE modem, the Snapdragon 845-powered phones will support theoretical download speed of up to 1.2gbps. The upload speed limit is 150mpbs. Of course in India no telecom operator offers network that supports the kind of network speed that the Snapdragon 845 can manage.</p></li><li><p>Snapdragon 845 comes with support for fully-functional dual SIM cards. This means in a Snapdragon 845-powered phone you will be able to use 4G SIM cards from Airtel as well as Jio on both SIM cards, 4G along with VoLTE will work.</p></li></ol>', 'Qualcomm Snapdragon 845,smartphone,features ', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),
(131, 'Microsoft''s Edge browser is in serious trouble', 'Kishan Sheth', '12-12-2017', 4, '135.jpg', '<p>Microsoft&#39;s Edge browser is less popular with Windows 10 users than earlier thought, if revised data from a U.S. analytics vendor can be believed.</p><p>According to Net Applications of Aliso Viejo, Calif., Edge has been designated the primary browser by fewer than one in six Windows 10 users for more than a year and a half. That&#39;s a significant downgrading of Edge&#39;s user share statistics from the browser&#39;s portrayal before this month.</p><p>During the 19-month span between May 2016 and November 2017 - data for that stretch was what Net Applications offered publicly - Edge was run by between 15.6% (in April 2017) and 12.2% (September 2017) of all Windows 10 users. It never reached 16.7% - or one in six - and trended downward overall, starting the period at 14.8% (May 2016) and ending it at 13.2% (November 2017), an 11% decline.</p><p>Edge had never been a big performer in the Net Applications&#39; user share sweepstakes, but in earlier data iterations, the web measurement company had painted the browser in somewhat brighter colors.</p><p>Before Net Applications&#39; methodology modification, Edge was the choice of between 28.5% (in May 2016) and 15.7% (October 2017) of all Windows 10 users. While that was ultimately a steeper decline, for most of the period Edge&#39;s share of Windows 10 hovered around the 21% to 22% mark. Only in the last three months did the older data show Edge&#39;s place on Windows 10 start to slide, perhaps a sign that Net Applications&#39; new data scheme was implemented before the firm made the news public.</p><p>Why did Edge&#39;s portrait change so dramatically? <em>Bots</em> is the answer.</p><p>&quot;Bots can cause significant skewing of data,&quot; <a href="https://netmarketshare.com/welcome" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">admitted Net Applications</a>earlier this month when it revealed its revised numbers. &quot;We have seen situations where traffic from certain large countries is almost completely bot traffic. In other countries, ad fraudsters generate traffic that spoofs certain technologies in order to generate high-value clicks. Or, they heavily favor a particular browser or platform.&quot;</p><p>These software tools often are deployed by criminals, who program their automated scripts to mimic human online behavior so that they can cash in on ad click fraud.</p><p>Net Applications did its best to scrub the bot traffic from its data, both current and past. &quot;The primary focus ... was to build detection methods to eliminate this traffic,&quot; the company said. &quot;We rewrote the entire collection and aggregation infrastructure to address this issue.&quot;</p><p>The resulting data, which Net Applications implied depicted Edge&#39;s real use, showed that the browser was a prime target of bot-wielding scammers. By comparing Edge&#39;s old and new shares, it was evident that as much as half of the earlier Edge traffic had been faked by bots. The portion of Edge&#39;s share credited to bots fluctuated month to month, but fell below 30% in only 4 of the 19 months for which Net Applications provided data.</p><p>Edge wasn&#39;t the only browser that came out looking worse than presumed prior. Microsoft&#39;s legacy browser, Internet Explorer (IE) also was revealed as a Potemkin village. Under the old data regime, which included bots, IE&#39;s user share was overblown, at times more than double the no-bots reality.</p><p>Take May 2016 as an example. With bots, Net Applications pegged IE at 33.7%; without bots, IE&#39;s user share dwindled to just 14.9%.</p><p>Together, IE and Edge - in other words, Microsoft&#39;s browsers - accounted for only 16.3% of the global user share last month using Net Applications&#39; new calculations. Back in January, however, IE+Edge had a user share of 24.1% with bots, just 14.9% without the shady tools.</p><p>Put plainly, Microsoft&#39;s place in the browser race, while definitely dismal when calculated previously, became ghastly when the bot traffic was subtracted.</p><p>Other data sources also called IE&#39;s and Edge&#39;s position weak, and long before Net Applications scoured its data. Irish metrics vendor StatCounter, for instance, has regularly pegged the browsers&#39; <em>usage share</em> - a proxy for activity rather than an estimate of user base - at levels much lower than its American rival.</p><p>A year ago, StatCounter said IE accounted for a mere 9.8% of the world&#39;s browser usage share, compared to the 19.9% of Net Applications with bots and 14.9% without bots. Last month, StatCounter still pegged IE lower (8.5%) than Net Applications&#39; bots-be-gone figure (12%), but the difference between the two data sets has been steadily shrinking.</p><p>Interestingly, Edge&#39;s share of all browser usage on Windows 10 has remained remarkably stable in StatCounter&#39;s tallies, falling within a narrow range of 10.1% to 10.9% over the past 12 months.</p><p>Bottom line: The data from both Net Applications and StatCounter indicate Windows 10 users are shunning Edge, and former IE users are renouncing that browser at a pace alarming to Microsoft. In fact, the combined IE and Edge now face a once unthinkable fate: falling beneath Mozilla&#39;s Firefox.</p><p>That&#39;s already happened in StatCounter&#39;s figuring, which has tapped Firefox with more usage share than IE+Edge in 12 of the last 13 months. The gap between IE+Edge and Firefox in Net Applications&#39; reckoning is more substantial - with the edge, no pun intended, to Microsoft&#39;s browsers - but the disparity is waning. If Firefox can regroup, stem its latest losses and return to the position it had as recently as March, it could shove IE+Edge off the No. 2 spot and claim it as its own.</p>', 'Microsoft,Edge, browser ', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),
(132, 'Apple''s affordable 9.7-inch iPad in 2018 could boost a slumping tablet market', 'Dhruvil Raithatha', '12-12-2017', 3, '136.jpg', '<p>Apple is reportedly planning to come out with cheaper iPads in 2018 as it looks increase sales of its tablets in a market that has seen a bit of a slowdown in recent years. Next year&#39;s regular 9.7-inch iPad could be launched starting at $259 (approx Rs 16,700), which will be even lower compared to this year&#39;s 9.7-inch iPad at $329 (approx Rs 21,500). At this pricing, the iPad will become even more attractive for consumers who have desired an iPad, but dreaded Apple&#39;s premium pricing scheme.</p><p>News of a cheaper iPad came via Digitimes <a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/technology/story/apple-working-on-a-9-7-inch-ipad-under-rs-20000-could-launch-it-in-2018/1/1101750.html" target="_blank">late last week</a>, which said that the upcoming tablet should attract price-oriented consumers and will help Apple maintain its current 10 million-unit shipments a quarter. &quot;With the new device, the sources expect the tablet market to witness a new wave of price competition among first-tier players including Samsung Electronics, Amazon, Huawei and Lenovo,&quot; the report quotes.</p><p>While there isn&#39;t an exact date of launch of the cheaper iPad, the report says that it could arrive in the second quarter of 2018. The yet-to-come iPad will likely replace this year&#39;s 9.7-inch iPad or act as a more stripped down version of it. Despite the slowdown in the tablet market in recent years, Apple&#39;s iPad has maintained its top position as far as sales are concerned. As per IDC&#39;s Q3 2017 report, Apple continued its dominance thanks to the cheaper $329 iPad that was launched earlier this year.</p><p>A sub-Rs 20,000 iPad from Apple will put the company more in line to compete against the likes of Samsung, Huawei and Lenovo, to name a few. Apple uses its mobile OS for its iPad, while the others typically run on Windows OS. This gives Apple an edge as it is able to provide an ecosystem and brand loyalty compared to its competition, and not to mention timely updates. This year&#39;s iPad has already seen a pickup in sales, especially in countries like China and India thanks to its mid-range price point. Analysts have also predicted in the past that these markets are the future for Apple products, which is why a cheaper iPad next year could attract more consumers in these markets.</p><p>If the Cupertino giant does indeed bring an even cheaper iPad to the market next year, we can expect sales to pick up a lot more and give a boost to the tablet market. Not only will it attract Apple loyalists, but it is likely to bring in consumers who have been itching to switch to a tablet from PCs or for multimedia purposes. With iOS 11 now out and bringing tablet-focused features like split-view multitasking and drag-and-drop, the iPad is closer to being your PC substitute than ever before. But one will have to wait and see if a cheaper iPad will bring anything new to the table.</p><p>Additionally, apart from the regular consumers, the upcoming iPad will also look to attract industrial and service sectors, last week&#39;s report adds. While the standard 9.7-inch iPad looks to get cheaper in 2018, Apple&#39;s iPad Pro may get costlier if recent reports suggesting they&#39;ll come with slimmer bezels and Face ID facial recognition are true. KGI Securities analysts Ming-Chi Kuo said a couple of months ago that the iPad Pro models next year will feature a TrueDepth camera and Face ID, as seen in the latest iPhone X.</p><p>What this points to is two distinct iPad categories next year - one being a budget iPad that will likely feature 2017 hardware and a standard iPad design, while the other being the high-end iPhone X-like iPad with premium features such as facial recognition and slimmer bezels. This distinction will provide users a better decision-making power regarding the kind of iPad they want to go for.</p>', 'Apple,tablet,iPad', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),
(133, 'OnePlus 5T: Should OnePlus 5 users upgrade?', 'Dhruvil Raithatha', '12-12-2017', 15, '137.jpg', '<p>Just a few months after launch, the OnePlus 5 is already old news - made obsolete by the OnePlus 5T which embraces 2017 trends and comes with what has become the flavour of the season - a &#39;bezel-less&#39; design.&nbsp;</p><p>But is the OnePlus 5 really obsolete? Should OnePlus 5 owners wallow in self-pity or be content with their smartphones? Does the 5T actually warrant an upgrade? The answer to that question is as easy as it is complicated. &nbsp;In essence, the OnePlus 5T is just the 5 with an edge-to-edge display and an updated (supposedly) dual camera setup. But there is more to the picture than what meets the eye.</p><h3><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Reasons to upgrade</span></h3><p>The biggest reason to upgrade lies on the front fascia of the OnePlus 5T - the 6.01-inch &#39;edge-to-edge&#39; display. The ultra-wide 18:9 display lends itself well to multimedia consumption and gaming and helps the OnePlus 5T come across as fresh and current. The FullHD+ AMOLED panel is vibrant and punchy and has good brightness levels to boot.</p><p>With the edge-to-edge display, the bezels up front have also packed their bags and gone on vacation &nbsp;- at least most of them. The OnePlus 5T is not entirely as bezel-less as the Galaxy S8 and iPhone X but then again nor is it nearly as pricey. The minimal bezels lend themselves to a modern and futuristic look &nbsp;- one that makes the OnePlus 5 look dated.</p><p>The biggest reason to upgrade lies on the front fascia of the OnePlus 5T - the 6.01-inch &#39;edge-to-edge&#39; display</p><p>If you are sick of the grainy low-light images produced by the OnePlus 5, the OnePlus 5T might be worth upgrading to. The telephoto sensor has made way for a new &#39;low-light&#39; 20MP secondary sensor that merges four pixels into one in order to improve low light photography. It has an aperture of f/1.7 and a pixel size of 1 microns.</p><p>While the difference is not day and night, the OnePlus 5T produces slightly better low light photos than the OnePlus 5. Another reason to consider the OnePlus 5T is the facial recognition tech OnePlus has incorporated inside the front camera. Unlike the iPhone X, that has a dedicated TrueDepth sensor, OnePlus relies on its 16MP front camera to identify over 100 points in a user&#39;s face - and it works quite well for the most part.</p><h3><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Reasons to stick to OnePlus 5</span></h3><p>There are several reasons why OnePlus 5 owners should stick to their smartphones until the OnePlus 6 at the very minimum. The primary amongst them is the fact that the OnePlus 5T comes with the exact same internals as the OnePlus 5. The combination of 6/8GB of RAM and the Snapdragon 835 processor was so competent to begin with that OnePlus saw no reason to mess with it in the OnePlus 5T.</p><p>Thus the OnePlus 5 is an extremely powerful smartphone that should serve its users well for quite some time. The 5T might have a taller display and minimal bezels up front, but when it comes to performance , there is no difference between the 5 and 5T.</p><p>The biggest reason to stick with the OnePlus 5 is the OnePlus 6 which is sure to bring with it major hardware updates</p><p>Secondly, OnePlus has already confirmed that the OnePlus 5 will receive the Android 8.0 Oreo update along with the OnePlus 5T in January 2018. So software wise, OnePlus is keeping the OnePlus 5 on the same footing as the OnePlus 5T - atleast for now.</p><p>Another reason OnePlus 5 users should save their money and stick with their smartphones is the OnePlus 5T&#39;s design - which is more or less the same as its predecessor. Apart from the minimal bezels up front and the subsequent movement of the fingerprint sensor to the back panel, the basic design language has remained unchanged.</p><p>The dual camera setup on the OnePlus 5T is also an odd duck. OnePlus has completely ditched the telephoto sensor found on the OnePlus 5 for a new 20MP sensor. This new secondary sensor, with an aperture of f/1.7 and a pixel size of 1 microns, is supposed to help out in low-light by merging four pixels into one.</p><p>While the low light photos are slightly better, fans of the telephoto sensor which allows for 2X optical zoom should definitely stick to the OnePlus 5.

(134, 'Djay Pro 2 comes with AI that can mix songs together for you', 'Dhruvil Raithatha', '12-12-2017', 6, '138.jpg', '<p>Algoriddim&rsquo;s next generation of its DJ software, <a href="https://www.algoriddim.com/">Djay Pro 2</a>, has just been released, available for macOS. The program, meant for both amateur and professional DJs, allows users to mix music entirely within the app, or use in conjunction with external hardware for performing, the way Traktor and other DJ apps are used.</p><p>The few things that prevented Djay Pro from being true crossover professional software have now been added with the new version. Djay Pro 2 comes with, among other changes, a revamped user interface and an advanced library management system and core updates that make the app more nimble to use for those with large libraries of music.</p><p>Much of what users loved about the first version of Djay Pro remains intact. The app integrates with your Spotify Premium account, meaning you can instantly DJ using any song found on Spotify at 320kbps. You can even pull curated playlists to find music by mood and genre. It can also pull playlists from your iTunes library, or can be directed to source music stored anywhere on your computer or other connected devices. It&rsquo;s also carried over functions like the ability to record your mixed output, transpose a song&rsquo;s key or sort by song key, apply audio effects like a bit crusher or echo, and set loops and cue points.</p><p>Some of the added robustness to Djay Pro 2 lies behind the scenes. You can now access a full keyboard editor, which allows users to customize all their keyboard shortcuts, from how to load songs onto decks to individual EQ controls. I found this especially useful, immediately re-mapping some basic controls to mimic what I was already familiar with in Serato, the software I currently use.</p><p>Djay Pro 2&rsquo;s new library management system is also worth pointing out. It&rsquo;s smart and flexible, allowing users to set parameters for music management in several different ways. Users can split the lower half of the screen to show multiple playlists side by side and filter to find songs based on multiple rules. (For example, you could search for songs within a certain BPM range, and genre, and artist.)</p><p>Perhaps most noteworthy (and what will make most DJs cluck disapprovingly upon first announcement) is that Djay Pro 2 comes with Automix AI, a way for the software to intelligently mix music on its own with no human interaction. Previously, Djay Pro offered some automation, like the ability to sync the BPM of two songs, and Match, its song recommendation system that automatically pulls songs from Spotify that will sound good when played together. However, the actual mix between songs still had to be done by a human.</p><p>When Automix is enabled, Djay Pro 2 takes over, scanning the song&rsquo;s rhythmic patterns and determining where the best intro and outro sections are for transitioning to the next song. All the ways Automix works, from the duration of the mix to how it handles tempo, can be adjusted, but the automatic settings are darn good.</p><p>Watching Automix at work is wild. It will select the next song from your library that will best match with what&rsquo;s currently playing, slowly fade over once it&rsquo;s time to mix out, and even employ on-the-fly EQing and filters during the transition. It&rsquo;s not perfect; there were several times I tried to &ldquo;trick&rdquo; the software by throwing it odd tempo changes or songs with little to no intro and the resulting mix was clunky. But in other instances it surprised me. It handled a transition from a &ldquo;Believe&rdquo; by A-Trak feat. Quavo and Lil Yachty at 71 BPM to Piatto&rsquo;s &ldquo;Work That&rdquo; at 128 BPM with relative smoothness, and even an echo out! I could see this being employed at a house party, during a long club set if you were performing and had to duck to the restroom, or even used by a venue pre-show or if music is needed in an emergency while a technical problem is being dealt with. (I currently have Automix at work in the background while I&rsquo;m writing.)</p><p>If you use visuals while you DJ, Djay Pro 2 has built upon its existing video mode. Like in the previous version, you can mix videos with a grip of built-in transitions, apply reactive visualizers with motion graphics that sync to your music, and overlay graphics with text or additional images, like a logo. Added to this is a new function called PhotoBeat that will let you drag photos in and have a slideshow auto-generate that displays in time with the music. Effects can be added to the photos, just as with video, and all visuals can be projected to an external monitor via HDMI or AirPlay.</p><p>Djay Pro 2 is essentially so powerful it&rsquo;s hard to cover all it does here. (It even works with VoiceOver, meaning users who are blind can still use the program.) It&rsquo;s also compatible with over 60 MIDI controllers and is certified by Pioneer DJ for plug and play integration, meaning any cue points or meta data you assign in app will carry over to Pioneer DJ hardware, the current standard in most nightclubs. It&rsquo;s fair to say Djay Pro 2 is not only simple enough for casual users to try, it&rsquo;s also in-depth enough to be a viable contender to current professional DJ software options. I&rsquo;m even considering switching from Serato and Rekordbox to this.</p><p>Djay Pro 2 for Mac is available now for a limited time introductory price of $39.99 (US) from the Mac App Store. The company has not said how long the sale price will be available, but afterward, the standard price will be $49.99.</p>', 'Djay Pro 2,AI,Songs', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),

Two black rectangles sit on either side of a square, a neon smiley face suspended upside down in the center. Inside, a few small cylinders of pink marble serve as tables, but seating for customers is limited.

For the steady stream of tourists and bloggers who stopped in while I was there, the shop is first and foremost a visual treat, offering itself up as a backdrop for user&rsquo;s to craft a winning Instagram post. The content of your photo is important, but as any serious Instagrammer knows, the hashtags you attach are equally important (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/postitfortheaesthetic/">#postitfortheaesthetic</a>). Someone may have just a few dozen followers, but by grouping their post through hashtags, they can get their images in front of thousands, even millions of potential viewers, all of whom tune in each day for hashtags about food, fashion, and sparkly colors.</p><p>Up until now, there were two ways to interact with a hashtag. You could click through a hashtag on a post, or you could search for a specific tag in the Explore section of the app. Today, Instagram is introducing a new way to interact with hashtags. You can now &ldquo;follow&rdquo; a hashtag the same way you would follow an account. Instagram&rsquo;s algorithms will then pick and choose some of the highlights from that collection and surface them in your main feed. It&rsquo;s a fundamental change to one of the largest social media platforms in the world, elevating your interest in adorable dogs or expensive automobiles to equal status with your friends and family.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been testing out the feature for the last two weeks, and I find myself spending more time with Instagram as a result. I have always avoided the Explore tab. It felt like a random mishmash of posts personalized for me and generic viral content optimized to be popular. Take a recent experience I had with the &ldquo;videos you might like&rdquo; channel: it started with a highlight from a UFC fight, perfect for me, before segueing to a clip of random teens slapping each other at a party, Beyonc&eacute; accepting an award, a volcano erupting against the night sky, and a strange-looking fence post that turns out to be a well-camouflaged bird, shared by an account named &ldquo;ifyouhigh.&rdquo; It was as discordant as flipping through channels on your cable box.</p><p>By contrast, the posts injected into my main feed based on the hashtags I chose to follow (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/modernart/">#modernart</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/bjj/">#bjj</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/ancient/">#ancient</a>) felt carefully curated. There is a lot of variety, even within those categories, but you can train the algorithm on what you do and don&rsquo;t like. Engage with the post by leaving a heart or a comment, and Instagram will assume you want more. Click the menu button on the top right of the post, and you can downvote the offending image by asking Instagram not to show you similar content for that hashtag again. After a few days of this, the art in my feed, both martial and modern, felt fine-tuned to my taste.</p>', 'INSTAGRAM,#INTERESTING', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),

(139, 'HARMAN KARDON INVOKE REVIEW: CORTANA GETS A SPEAKER OF ITS OWN', 'Kishan Sheth', '12-12-2017', 9, '143.jpg', '<p>For a company that makes a voice-controlled assistant, it has become table stakes to have a smart speaker for the home that uses it: Amazon&rsquo;s Alexa debuted on the Echo smart speaker three years ago, Google now has a complete lineup of Home speakers that use the Google Assistant, and Apple&rsquo;s forthcoming HomePod is powered by, you guessed it, Siri.</p><p>Not one to be left out of the party, there&rsquo;s now a smart wireless speaker that uses Microsoft&rsquo;s Cortana assistant. The $199 Harman Kardon Invoke is not hugely different than the Amazon Echo or Google Home. It has seven far-field microphones to hear your voice commands from across the room. It has a circular light on top that illuminates when it hears its wake word or is responding to a request. And it can be used to deliver facts, perform unit conversions, set timers or alarms, look up directions, control smart home gadgets, or add things to a to-do or shopping list.</p><p>The Invoke can also be used to listen to music, and this is where it separates itself from devices from Amazon and Google. The Invoke has more powerful speakers than either of its competitors, and, as a perhaps obvious result, it sounds a lot better than the Echo or Home. Since Amazon itself admits that the thing people use the Echo for more than any other is to listen to music, the Invoke&rsquo;s improved audio experience is definitely appreciated.</p><p>But that experience comes at a cost, and the price difference between the Invoke and the others is not insignificant. Further, while Cortana is a capable virtual assistant, it&rsquo;s clear that this device is Microsoft&rsquo;s first effort in this space, and it has some catching up to do with Alexa and Google&rsquo;s Assistant.</p><p>The only physical controls on the Invoke are the volume ring at the top (which effectively works identically to the first-gen Echo&rsquo;s, but has smoother damping), a touch-sensitive pad on the top, and the mute and Bluetooth buttons on the back. The Invoke can be used as a standard Bluetooth speaker, but it cannot connect to a larger speaker either over Bluetooth or with an aux cable like the newer Echo devices can.</p><p>Not that you&rsquo;d have much of a reason to hook the Invoke up to another speaker even if it could. Under the speaker grille are three 1.75-inch midrange drivers and three 0.5-inch tweeters, arranged in an outward-facing circle to provide 360 degrees of sound. The Invoke doesn&rsquo;t have a subwoofer, but there is a passive radiator to enhance the bass. All of this is pushed by a 40-watt amplifier, which Harman Kardon boasts is more powerful than any of its direct competitors.</p><p>This speaker array makes the Invoke much nicer to listen to than the Echo (even the new and supposedly improved model) and the Google Home. It fills a room with sound much better than either of those speakers, and though it won&rsquo;t be suitable for bumping a house party, it has actual bass response, which is all but non-existent in the others. The Invoke&rsquo;s only real competitor here is the equally priced Sonos One, which is louder still with even better bass.</p><p>The touch-sensitive pad at the top of the speaker will illuminate with a blue-and-white circle whenever the &ldquo;Hey Cortana&rdquo; wake-up command is said. It will shine red when the speaker is muted, and it will display a white ring when you adjust the volume. It&rsquo;s easier to see across the room than the lights on the Google Home, but the Echo&rsquo;s brighter ring is better still.</p><p>You can tap the top of the Invoke to pause music that&rsquo;s playing or cancel a command. If you tap it when the Invoke isn&rsquo;t doing anything, Cortana will serve up a random fact.</p><p>But like the Echo and Google Home, the main way you&rsquo;re supposed to use the Invoke is through voice commands. It&rsquo;s very good at hearing my voice from across the room, even while music is playing, and it rarely failed when I barked a command at it. It only responds to &ldquo;Hey Cortana,&rdquo; however, and you cannot change it to a different wake word. Saying &ldquo;Hey Cortana&rdquo; every time is more tedious than the Echo&rsquo;s simpler &ldquo;Alexa&rdquo; command, especially if you&rsquo;re saying it multiple times in a row to perform different actions.</p><p>At launch, the Invoke works with Spotify, TuneIn, and iHeartRadio, with support for Pandora promised to come. I was able to pull up specific albums or playlists from my Spotify account, and even save new tracks to my library or follow a playlist with just a voice command. The Invoke <a href="https://twitter.com/dcseifert/status/920685329954336769">wasn&rsquo;t able to find everything</a>, however, and it tended to fall back to a generic artist playlist when it couldn&rsquo;t find the specific album I asked for. Other music services can be played via Bluetooth, but voice commands are limited to volume control and pause / resume / next / previous track control in Bluetooth mode.</p><p>As a personal assistant, the Invoke is most useful if you already live in Microsoft&rsquo;s ecosystem. It can pull up calendar information from Outlook.com and Office 365 accounts, and it can add items to a to-do list in the Cortana app on a phone or Windows 10 computer. You can even ask the Invoke to remind you at a specific time or location and your other devices will light up when the task is due. But if you use other services for your calendar, Cortana can&rsquo;t access them at all, which meant it couldn&rsquo;t see any of the calendar appointments in my Google Calendar account. It also couldn&rsquo;t access or control my to-do list or shopping list in Todoist, which I&rsquo;m able to do with either the Echo or Google Home.</p><p>For smart home control, the Invoke works with SmartThings, Philips Hue, Nest, Wink, and Insteon out of the box, which covers a large number of smart home gadgets. I was able to voice control my lights with Hue or SmartThings using the Invoke, just like I can on the Echo or Google Home. Microsoft says it is working with Honeywell, Ecobee, TP-Link, Johnson Controls, IFTT, Geeni, Iris by Lowe&rsquo;s, and iDevices to add support for those products and services in Cortana.</p><p>The Invoke can also be used to place calls, using Microsoft&rsquo;s Skype service. The company says it&rsquo;s Skype certified for conference calling, but it my tests, callers were distant and they had trouble hearing me, so it wasn&rsquo;t a great experience. The Invoke cannot be used as a Bluetooth speakerphone for standard calls, which is probably for the best given my experience with the Skype calling feature.</p><p>Beyond those music and productivity functions, the Invoke can be used to answer facts and trivia; provide weather forecasts, news updates, and traffic information; and provide some quick entertainment, such as telling jokes or poems. It&rsquo;s not unlike Alexa or the Google Assistant in this respect, and it didn&rsquo;t have any trouble performing unit conversions or telling me when the local Home Depot closes and how long it will take me to get there when I asked.</p><p>Aside from the fact that it works best with Microsoft&rsquo;s own services and doesn&rsquo;t support others, Cortana&rsquo;s biggest limitation is that it can only support one account at this time. Calendar information, reminders, and to-dos will all be pulled from the account the Invoke was set up with, which makes it difficult to use as a shared device for those functions. Both Alexa and Google&rsquo;s Assistant have added features that attempt to identify the person making the voice request and serve up personalized information to them. And while the Invoke does sound good on its own, it can&rsquo;t be paired in stereo or be used in a multi-room system, like Google, Amazon, or Sonos speakers can.</p><p>And then there&rsquo;s the cost: the Invoke is twice as expensive as Amazon&rsquo;s new Echo, $70 more than the Google Home, and the same price as the new Sonos One, which sounds better and has more flexibility with multi-room setups. If you just want a simple voice-controlled smart speaker, it&rsquo;s hard to argue with Amazon&rsquo;s Echo, and if you care deeply about sound quality, the Sonos One (which has Alexa built in) is probably a better option.</p><p>But if you do live in Microsoft&rsquo;s world and sound quality has some importance to you, there&rsquo;s a lot to like about the Invoke. It&rsquo;s further along than where Amazon or Google were at their debuts, and it already does a lot of things you want a smart speaker to do. Plus, it doesn&rsquo;t compromise on sound quality quite as much as the others.</p><p>If Microsoft is able to deliver those promised improvements and perhaps make Cortana work better with non-Microsoft services, the Invoke could be a compelling smart speaker for the rest of us.</p>', 'HARMAN KARDON ,CORTANA,Speaker', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),

Strange as it might seem to old-school phone users who remember when people used to communicate using voice and text, emoji are actually used often to convey real meaning. Google says it wanted to help avoid miscommunication by helping to make sure emoji are as consistent as possible when used across platforms: Those blobs often seemed to mean very different things from their iOS equivalents.</p><p>Android O also includes 69 new emoji, as included in the Unicode 10 emoji set.

In fact, Facebook Creator is really just an updated and rebranded version of that app &mdash; originally called Facebook Mentions (and still called that, since it seems to be stuck that way on the App Store for now) &mdash; but now it&rsquo;s open to everyone.</p><p>There are two main draws to the Creator app. First, it includes some special features for Facebook Live. Anyone using it will be able to create custom intros and outros &mdash; intros are especially handy, as it takes a moment before other people see the link and start watching &mdash; as well as the ability to add interactive stickers and a custom video frame. The app is also able to take and edit photos and post them to Facebook Stories and other platforms (it&rsquo;s not clear if that includes Instagram, but it really should).</p><p>The second big draw is communication. The app creates a unified inbox for comments on Facebook and Instagram and messages from Messenger, so that you don&rsquo;t have to bounce between different apps in order to respond to people. The app doesn&rsquo;t seem to cover every possible messaging vector inside of Facebook&rsquo;s services, but it sounds like a handy start.</p><p>Finally, there are analytics too, so that creators can obsessively refresh the page wondering whether they&rsquo;ve successfully gamed Facebook&rsquo;s latest algorithm change.

After developers indicated their frustrating with the lack of powerful options Apple was selling (particularly as it related to the MacBook Pro), Apple said it would <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/4/15175916/apple-mac-pro-redesign-plans">release a new Mac Pro</a> and introduce an iMac Pro as well.</p><p>Of the two, the iMac Pro is the only one we&rsquo;ve seen any details on so far.

You&rsquo;ll probably even hear a few of the telltale shrieks that come from someone&rsquo;s first VR experience. Today, IMAX is opening the latest of its IMAX VR centers with its first location in Canada. The launch follows VR installations in theaters in Shanghai and New York, as well as a flagship location in Los Angeles that debuted back in January.</p><p>According to Mark Welton, president of IMAX Theaters, the current locations have been successful at capturing audiences who are already going to the movies. But with its central location and prominence within the theater, the new Toronto arcade could represent something different: an experience where people go explicitly to check out the latest in virtual reality, as opposed to simply jumping in after they watch a movie. &ldquo;I think this site is going to be different,&rdquo; says Welton.</p><p>Design-wise, the Toronto arcade is similar to the existing IMAX VR locations. It features 10 pods, which look like vaguely futuristic cubicles that are empty aside from the necessary VR gear. The pods are designed to be modular; currently they&rsquo;re small cubes, but walls can be removed to create larger spaces for more free-flowing VR installations. The current slate of VR experiences features a number of familiar faces, like the shooter <em>John Wick Chronicles</em>, sci-fi co-op game <em>Raw Data</em>, Ubisoft&rsquo;s <em>Eagle Flight</em>, and the team-based <em>Star Trek: Bridge Crew</em>.</p><p>Most games use the HTC Vive, while a few utilize the fledgling StarVR headset, which features a greater 210-degree field of view. Currently, only <em>John Wick</em> supports StarVR, but there&rsquo;s also an experience based on <em>The Mummy</em> in the works. Most of the experiences also utilize some form of force feedback &mdash; either through a chair or Subpac rumble backpacks &mdash; and IMAX says that it&rsquo;s experimenting with potentially adding smell for a full &ldquo;4D&rdquo; experience.</p><p>Along with the new arcade, today also marks the launch of a new collection of <em>Justice League</em> experiences. The new <em>Justice League</em>VR game &mdash; which at launch is exclusive to IMAX &mdash; lets you play as each member of the superhero team in different scenarios, and I was able to try three of them. As the Flash, you run through a subway tunnel, dodging obstacles by stepping left and right. You can also drive the Batmobile, using the HTC Vive&rsquo;s motion controllers to turn the steering wheel and fire machine guns at a seemingly never-ending onslaught of enemy vehicles. As Aquaman, meanwhile, you swim down a trench and stab a giant sea creature with a trident. Each is exciting while being simple enough you can understand in a single, short playthrough. They&rsquo;re also mostly on rails so that it&rsquo;s impossible to get lost.</p><p>The <em>Justice League</em> experience came about through IMAX&rsquo;s VR fund, which will see the company co-finance an expected 25 VR experiences over the next three years. The idea is to partner with prominent names in the film space &mdash; so far the likes of Justin Lin and the Russo brothers have signed up &mdash; to create exclusive experiences that make sense in a theater environment. IMAX is also working with Google to develop what it describes as a &ldquo;cinema-grade VR camera&rdquo; for these filmmakers to utilize. It&rsquo;s expected to launch in 2018.</p><p>Though it&rsquo;s been close to a year since the first IMAX VR location debuted, the project is still very much a work in progress. Welton describes it as being in a &ldquo;pilot phase.&rdquo; Certain elements, like pricing and content, are still in flux and regularly change. At the Toronto location, for instance, you can buy tickets for each individual experience, which range for $8 to $15 and last an average 10 minutes each. Meanwhile, other locations include an option to buy a ticket that gets you an unlimited amount of play within a fixed period of time.</p><p>The team at IMAX is also still figuring out what, exactly, theatergoers want out of a VR experience. According to Welton, over the first 10 months of the project people have gravitated to more social experiences; not just ones that are fun to play together, but also ones that are entertaining to watch as a group. (The VR pods feature low walls on one side so it&rsquo;s easy to see people flailing about while pretending to be The Flash.) IMAX has also introduced a new color-coded system that gives you a better idea of what kind of VR experience you&rsquo;re in for when you buy a ticket. Each individual experience is given a handful of qualifiers &mdash; such as &ldquo;casual,&rdquo; &ldquo;action,&rdquo; &ldquo;physically active,&rdquo; or &ldquo;age restrictive&rdquo; &mdash; so you know what you&rsquo;re spending $10 on.</p><p>Despite its prominent location, the new Toronto VR arcade doesn&rsquo;t necessarily represent a future direction for these installations. Instead, Welton says, IMAX will be tailoring each arcade to its location&rsquo;s specific needs. There are plans for six more VR setups in theaters across the globe; an upcoming Manchester location, for instance, will feature a VR arcade in a prominent shopping plaza across the street from a theater. The idea is to try different things, and see what works. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re changing constantly,&rdquo; says Welton.</p>', 'Torontoâ€™,IMAX VR,virtual reality', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),

So much so that it&#39;s not new or surprising for OnePlus to drop the bomb on a major software update after committing to the cause that, &quot;every new OnePlus phone is guaranteed at least two major software updates post launch/availability&quot; just the way Google envisions it, although the global search engine giant has stepped up its game and guaranteed at least three years of Android software updates for the next-generation Pixel 2/Pixel 2 XL phones. It&#39;s not so much about OnePlus failing to fulfill its promise, as it is about the way it goes about launching its new phones.</p><p>Take last year&#39;s OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T for instance. The OnePlus 3 was launched in June 2016 with Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow: fair enough. The OnePlus 3T was launched in November 2016 with Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow as well: not cool. Both the OnePlus 3 and the OnePlus 3T started receiving the Android 7.1.1 Nougat update -- at the same time -- early this year.

This is because the OnePlus 3T was launched in November 2016 -- a good three months after Android Nougat was rolled out -- and yet OnePlus chose not to equip the OnePlus 3T with the latest and greatest in software. The reason cited: OnePlus wanted to update both the OnePlus 3 and the OnePlus 3T at the same time so OnePlus 3 users won&#39;t feel left out. The launch of the OnePlus 3T may have already irked most of them so it was only fair they weren&#39;t playing second fiddle as far as the software side was concerned.</p><p>For a bit of perspective, OnePlus famously went back on its promise to update the OnePlus 2 to Android 7.0 Nougat: so some would say, not all is lost</p><p>Fast forward to 2017. The OnePlus 5 was launched in June this year with Android 7.1.1 Nougat: fair enough. The OnePlus 5T was launched this month with Android 7.1.1 Nougat as well: not cool. Both the OnePlus 5 and the OnePlus 5T will start receiving the Android 8.0 Oreo update -- at the same time -- early next year. Unlike the OnePlus 3 and the OnePlus 3T, it did not take long for OnePlus to drop the bomb in the case of the OnePlus 5 and the OnePlus 5T.</p><p>Someone took to Reddit recently to ask OnePlus, &quot;Will the OnePlus 5/5T share the exact same update cycle like 3/3T did? If yes will Oreo count as one of the 2 major updates for the 5T?&quot;</p><p>Here is what Gary C from the OxygenOS team had to say:</p><p>&quot;OnePlus 5/5T will have the same update cycle like 3/3T.&quot;</p><p>While not directly confirmed, OnePlus has indirectly hinted that Android P will be the last major version update for the OnePlus 5 and the OnePlus 5T.</p><p>Let&#39;s do some math again:</p><p>-- OnePlus 5 launched with Android Nougat: Update 1 to Android Oreo: Update 2 to Android P: Two updates as promised</p><p>-- OnePlus 5T launched with Android Nougat: Update 1 to Android Oreo: Update 2 to Android P: Two updates as promised</p><h3><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">OnePlus offers best in hardware, it&#39;s about time it offers best in software as well</span></h3><p>While on paper it may seem that OnePlus will be heading to update both the OnePlus 5 and the OnePlus 5T for two OS versions, in real world usage: the cycle doesn&#39;t go down so well for OnePlus 5T users. This is because the OnePlus 5T was launched in November 2017 -- a good three months after Android Oreo was rolled out -- and yet OnePlus chose not to equip the OnePlus 5T with the latest and greatest in software. The reason cited: OnePlus wants to update both the OnePlus 5 and the OnePlus 5T at the same time so OnePlus 5 users won&#39;t feel left out. The launch of the OnePlus 5T may have already irked most of them so it was only fair they weren&#39;t playing second fiddle as far as the software side was concerned.</p><p>It must be understood that it&#39;s not new or surprising and OnePlus isn&#39;t the only company seemingly all over the place with major software updates, but it&#39;s a bit unusual that a newly launched flagship phone would be part of a discussion on ending updates. On the one hand, the OnePlus 5 and the OnePlus 5T did launch with Android Nougat, and if they get Android P that represents two major updates for the hardware. But, on the other hand, the OnePlus 5Tjust launched and OnePlus is already hinting at ending major updates</p><p>The OnePlus 5T is, in fact, a mid-cycle refresh of the original OnePlus 5. It exists so OnePlus can offer buyers more, without actually having to launch another flagship phone this year. The company has, after all, reiterated time and again that it would launch just the one flagship phone every year.</p><p>On the hindsight though, it would appear that OnePlus has two flagship phones now: OnePlus 5T and OnePlus 5. But, it&#39;s not that simple. For one, OnePlus has now discontinued the OnePlus 5 so you&#39;ll find it on Amazon India and in stores only until stocks last. The OnePlus 5T, more importantly, is an upgrade and a testament to OnePlus&#39; forward thinking philosophy. It&#39;s simply the OnePlus 5 with a tweaked design and tweaked cameras. There are a few other minor changes as well, but on the whole, the OnePlus 5T is still the OnePlus 5, only bigger (with best in-class display) and with an improved dual camera system. The OnePlus 5T cashes in on the winning formula of the OnePlus 5 and tries to better it even further: and gets most things right while at it. But, it still doesn&#39;t ship with the best in-class software. While phones like the HTC U11 Plus and the Sony Xperia XZ1 -- that ship with Android Oreo out-of-the-box -- may get at least one more update post Android P, the same may not be true about the OnePlus 5T.</p><p>For a bit of perspective, OnePlus famously went back on its promise to update the OnePlus 2 to Android 7.0 Nougat: so some would say, not all is lost. Also, just because a OnePlus phone may not be updated with the latest in Android, you must know, it&#39;s not really the end of the world for crying out loud. What&#39;s more important is that OnePlus makes it a point to roll out security updates more frequently than rivals: which means it still has your back.</p><p>The OnePlus 5T has already started receiving its first update just days after it went on sale in India. The new Oxygen OS 4.7.2 -- weighing in at 107MB -- brings along fix for the Wi-Fi WPA2 security issue or more precisely the KRACK vulnerability, optimisations related to fingerprint and face unlock and improvements related to EIS during 4K recording. The company has already hinted that it is working on improving the dual camera system on-board the OnePlus 5T and the same will be pushed out via a new software update in the days to come.</p><p>OnePlus is a young and emerging company. Although it has admitted that the OnePlus 2 and the OnePlus X were a failure, the company still has phones like the OnePlus One and the OnePlus 3/3T to brag about. At the same time, its fascination to offer the best in hardware courtesy its T-upgrades is commendable. All said and done, it&#39;s about time that the company pulls it socks up and starts offering the best in software as well because at the end of the day, it&#39;s software that pulls everything together to make a phone worth your while.

Whereas many developers and publishers have toyed with the medium, releasing smaller experiments to test the waters, over the last few weeks Bethesda has released three of its biggest games in VR. On the surface, it sounds great. With a VR headset, you can become fully immersed in the thrilling horror of <em>Doom</em>, the post-apocalyptic wasteland of <em>Fallout</em>, or <em>Skyrim</em>&rsquo;s picturesque fantasy realm.</p><p>In practice, though, the games don&rsquo;t work out quite so well. Each has been tweaked in some way to better suit virtual reality &mdash; <em>Doom</em>&rsquo;s action is less intense, while <em>Skyrim</em> now utilizes motion controls &mdash; but they&rsquo;re still clearly games designed for traditional screens. And, in most regards, they end up as a lesser experience in VR. It&rsquo;s impressive that Bethesda has managed to squeeze these massive games onto a headset at all, but the final products leave much to be desired.</p><p>An actual <em>Doom</em> VR game has been a long time coming. The very first thing we saw from the new wave of VR technology was <em>Doom 3</em> running on John Carmack&rsquo;s own prototype Oculus Rift back in 2012, after all. And, as last year saw both the release of actual, honest-to-goodness consumer VR headsets and an unexpectedly brilliant Doom reboot, the time is right for the two to come together.</p><p>That&rsquo;s certainly what you get with <em>Doom VFR</em>. (The &ldquo;F&rdquo; means the same thing as it does in <em>Doom&rsquo;</em>s infamous BFG weapon.) It uses last year&rsquo;s <em>Doom</em> as the technological base for a full-on room scale VR experience primarily designed for the HTC Vive. (It&rsquo;s also available for PlayStation VR, which I can&rsquo;t imagine would be much of an improvement, as well as the Oculus Rift if you&rsquo;re willing to implement some workarounds.) That sounds like a great idea, and id Software has done a lot right here. But ultimately <em>Doom VFR</em> doesn&rsquo;t quite work.</p><p>First comes the realization that <em>Doom 3</em> makes a lot more sense as a VR game than <em>Doom 2016</em>. The former surprised many upon its release by delivering a tense, intimate horror experience, while the reboot updated the series&rsquo; traditional breakneck action in style. <em>Doom</em>sees you take on dozens of enemies at once and requires extremely fast-paced movement, which simply wouldn&rsquo;t work in VR.</p><p>The developer deserves credit for recognizing this and attempting to craft a new <em>Doom</em>experience that feels native to the platform, and it&rsquo;s more ambitious than shooting gallery-type FPS adaptations like Serious Sam. It uses the same sort of teleportation movement seen in many other VR games, though there&rsquo;s actually an amusingly daft narrative explanation for this, and you&rsquo;re also able to make quick dashes and strafes with the trackpad. The level design is all new, enemy count is significantly reduced, and the gory finishing move mechanic has been adapted to make use of the teleportation controls. The visuals are pretty good, and it&rsquo;s definitely impressive to see the scale of a Cacodemon up close. <em>Doom VFR</em> has clearly been crafted with some thought.</p><p>On the other hand, it has some pretty major flaws. For one thing, the shooting largely feels terrible, which is somewhat of a deal breaker for <em>Doom</em>. Inexplicably, the weapons are orientated as if the barrel, not the gun handle, is aligned with the Vive controller handle, meaning you have to aim your hand about 45 degrees lower than you feel you ought to. It completely breaks immersion. And even when you do manage to sync your movements to the game, the weapons feel inaccurate anyway. You can improve your aim by getting close to the enemies, but you&rsquo;ll have to make sure not to get too close &mdash; clipping errors mean that you&rsquo;ll often end up shooting straight through them to no avail.</p><p>These control issues extend to more basic actions, too. A key example that I never got used to: you pick up items like keycards by pointing at them with your &ldquo;finger,&rdquo; rather than directly interacting with them in the more natural ways established by VR titles like <em>Job Simulator</em>. It doesn&rsquo;t help that I found collision detection to be pretty buggy, nor that the game often caused my headset to black out despite otherwise running smoothly. (Which, if you&rsquo;re not familiar with VR, is incredibly disorienting during the height of demon-blasting battle.) It&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re never able to get into the same shooting-chaining-finishing zone as <em>Doom</em>, but it doesn&rsquo;t ever quite feel right.</p><p><em>Doom VFR</em> is a weird combination of polish and lack thereof. It&rsquo;s not a slapdash port, and it was evidently designed from the ground up for VR. It&rsquo;s the kind of thing that VR enthusiasts should, on paper, be excited about. But the final result just doesn&rsquo;t match up to VR FPS games like <em>Raw Data</em> or <em>Arizona Sunshine</em>, which came from much smaller studios. I think there&rsquo;s a solid design somewhere in <em>Doom VFR</em>, and I hope id takes the time to tease it out.</p>', 'FALLOUT,VR,BLOCKBUSTER GAMES', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),

Prior to that, I was using the iPhone 8 Plus, which Apple loaned me. During the busy fall reviews season, I also used the Google Pixel 2 and briefly used the Essential smartphone.</p><p>But this article isn&rsquo;t a round up of these new phones or a direct comparison of all four. It&rsquo;s about the iPhone X.</p><p>Some of my fellow <em>Verge</em> writers determined that iPhone X is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/24/15914934/best-smartphone-apple-ios-google-android">&ldquo;easily the best smartphone ever made.&rdquo;</a> There are a lot of things to love about the iPhone X, including its ridiculously long battery life, excellent camera (front-facing Portrait mode!), and just how fast the thing is. I can see why my co-workers found true smartphone love. I haven&rsquo;t yet.</p><p>Nearly a month later, I&rsquo;m still adjusting to certain interactions on the iPhone X. It demands a precision in swiping and pressing that just makes me much more <em>aware</em> of the phone, rather than having the phone exist as a comfortable appendage, one that I need but don&rsquo;t need to think about much when I&rsquo;m using it.</p><p>I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;d get used to a couple of these new features with more time. Or maybe they&rsquo;ll be tweaked. But here are the things that are still bugging me about it.</p><h2><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">ONE-HANDED NOTIFICATION ACCESS IS BAD</span></strong></h2><p>I&rsquo;m obviously not the first person to notice this. When I ran a search for this problem to determine if it was <em>a thing</em> or if it was <em>just me</em>, I found <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/iphone-x-negative-review-2017-11">this article</a>, which describes what I&rsquo;ve been experiencing with the iPhone X.</p><p>If you have smallish hands, it can be difficult to use the phone in one hand and reach the upper left-hand corner of the display with your thumb to pull down notifications, which is where they now live. My thumb just doesn&rsquo;t reach. I either have to slide the phone down in my right hand, which means I&rsquo;ll probably drop it at some point; or I hold the phone in my left hand while using my right hand to pull down notifications.</p><p>I know Reachability is supposed to help this. But I still don&rsquo;t think this is a perfect solution. On earlier, Plus-sized iPhones, Reachability was easy to trigger with the physical home button. Reachability on the iPhone X requires a precise pull-down on the bar at the bottom of the home screen, and a slightly-off swipe opens up Spotlight search instead.</p><h2><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">THE STATUS BAR AT THE TOP NO LONGER SHOWS BATTERY LIFE PERCENTAGE</span></strong></h2><p>Yup. To the right of the notch at the top of the iPhone X, you see icons for cellular signal, WiFi, and a battery icon. What you don&rsquo;t see is battery life <em>percentage</em>.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not too far away: if you swipe down from the right-hand side of the notch to access the Control Center, the battery percentage appears. But you&rsquo;re no longer able to see it with a quick glance, which means you&rsquo;re now living in a binary battery world: green or red. And, while the Control Center is a little bit more customizable now, you can&rsquo;t customize the home screen so that it shows percentage.</p><h2><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">ERRANT SCREENSHOTS</span></strong></h2><p>With old iPhones, capturing an image of your phone screen was easy: you pressed the home button and the power button simultaneously. That&rsquo;s not the case with iPhone X, because, again, there isn&rsquo;t a home button. Now you press a combination of the right-side button and one of the volume buttons, which means that any time you just <em>happen</em> to squeeze your phone a certain way, you might take a screenshot.</p><p>To be honest, this has only happened a handful of times for me so far. Others are <a href="https://twitter.com/reckless/status/939039171590569984">experiencing it a lot more</a>. Either way it&rsquo;s not ideal.</p><h2><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">IT&rsquo;S AWKWARD TO USE WHEN IT&rsquo;S DOCKED IN A CAR</span></strong></h2><p><em>Why the hell are you using your phone while you&rsquo;re driving? This is the stupidest argument ever.</em> Alright, glad we got that out of the way.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t actively use my phone while I&rsquo;m driving. But I do prop my phone up in a dock on the dashboard and use it to listen to podcasts and music and take phone calls. (My car doesn&rsquo;t have a built-in, interactive display, so everything happens through the phone.) And, occasionally, I want to wake up or unlock the phone when the car is stopped.</p><p>With a fingerprint sensor/home button, unlocking the phone was easy. I didn&rsquo;t even have to look at the phone. Now I lean towards the center console and position my face in front of the phone for FaceID and when that doesn&rsquo;t work, I have to punch in a passcode.</p><p>Sure, I could change some settings each and every time I go somewhere, so that my screen never auto-locks, but then I&rsquo;d have to remember to turn that off afterwards, too. Basically, I miss having a fingerprint sensor/home button when the phone is within reach but is something I shouldn&rsquo;t be paying attention to.</p><h2><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">I FOUND MYSELF ACCIDENTALLY SWIPING THE DICTATION MICROPHONE</span></strong></h2><p>One of the biggest changes with the iPhone X has been swiping up from the bottom center of an app page in order to switch between apps, rather than double-pressing the physical home button.</p><p>But in certain messaging apps &ndash; whether Facebook Messenger, Messages, or WhatsApp &ndash; you have to swipe up precisely from the center and not slightly from the right, where your thumb is hanging out. Otherwise you end up triggering whatever button is hanging out on the bottom right-hand side of the keyboard. Which means hitting the dictation microphone rather than swiping the entire app away.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a minor thing, and you can turn dictation off entirely in keyboard settings. But it&rsquo;s one that underscores the importance of having thoughtfully-designed apps that are optimized for new interactions, especially when one of the most important companies in the world rolls out dramatic design changes.</p><p>Right now there&rsquo;s a good chance I&rsquo;m going back to an iPhone 8, or another phone. Some people would argue that, as a tech reviewer, I&rsquo;ll be putting myself in a position where I&rsquo;m using hardware that will soon feel (or already is) outdated &mdash; that the mobile world is moving away from buttons, has been for awhile, and I might as well get used to it. That may be the case, and this phone does feel like the <em>future&nbsp;</em>of phones. But until certain features and apps are truly optimized to support the new hardware, I&rsquo;m fine with having a phone that requires a little less cognitive load, a little less precision.</p>', 'iPhone X,features', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),

Listings for both products have returned to the site, but Amazon isn&rsquo;t accepting orders just yet. The company has directly confirmed to <em>The Verge</em> that it intends to do so in the near future. &ldquo;I can confirm that we are assorting Apple TV and Chromecast,&rdquo; a spokesperson said by email. The news was <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/amazon-to-start-selling-apple-tv-and-google-chromecast/">first reported by <em>CNet</em></a>.</p><p>Both the Apple TV and Chromecast were pulled from Amazon in late 2015. The company&rsquo;s justification for the move was that consumers would be confused and frustrated if they purchased streaming devices that didn&rsquo;t offer a direct, convenient way to view Amazon Prime Video content. In Apple&rsquo;s case, that impasse lasted until earlier this month when Amazon finally released a Prime Video app for Apple TV. (The new software <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/12/06/amazon-prime-apple-tv">has been met with some unfavorable reviews</a>.)</p><p>The Google situation is a bit more interesting for two reasons. First, Amazon Video still doesn&rsquo;t support the extremely popular Chromecast. And second, Amazon and Google are embroiled in a feud. Google is angry at Amazon for failing to support Google Cast (the technology that powers Chromecast) and for the retailer&rsquo;s long-running refusal to sell Google-branded products and some newer devices from its Nest subsidiary. (Google Home, for example, is still completely absent from Amazon.com.)</p><p>Things got pretty ugly and unnecessarily petty. If you asked an Echo device to order a Chromecast, Amazon would automatically put a Fire Stick in your cart instead. In retaliation to Amazon&rsquo;s moves, Google recently pulled YouTube from the Echo Show and announced plans to remove the app from Fire TV streaming devices as of January 1st. Amazon claims this amounts to &ldquo;selectively blocking customer access to an open website.&rdquo;</p><p>Amazon&rsquo;s restoration of Chromecast sales can be seen as a way of easing the escalating tensions between two tech giants. Perhaps Google might rethink its decision as a result and allow Fire TV owners to keep YouTube after all. The companies would do well to work things out: earlier today, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai referenced the public spat between Amazon and Google in his remarks during the commission&rsquo;s vote to kill net neutrality.</p>', 'Amazon,Google Chromecast,Apple TV', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),

But it <em>was</em> one of the most memorable, thanks in large part to its star, a towering bird-cat-dog hybrid named Trico. Playing as a young boy, you built a powerful and lasting relationship with the creature, which felt more like a real living thing than anything I&rsquo;d previously encountered in a virtual world. I still get chills thinking about the first time we met, and a little weepy when I remember the way the game ended. And it turns out that the feeling of connection is even more pronounced in virtual reality, which you can experience now through a free demo on PlayStation VR.</p><p>As the name implies, <em>The Last Guardian</em>&rsquo;s VR demo isn&rsquo;t the full version of the game playable with a headset. Instead, it&rsquo;s a handful of short scenes that take place within the game&rsquo;s mysterious, ancient world. You still play as the boy, this time taking in the world from a first-person perspective, and the controls have been incredibly simplified. You move around by selecting small statues and warping to their location, and there&rsquo;s only one button for interaction. You can use this to solve some light puzzles, like flipping a switch to open a gate, and to pick up barrels filled with a glowing goo that Trico can&rsquo;t seem to resist. It&rsquo;ll take you maybe 30 minutes to get through the whole experience.</p><p>But what <em>The Last Guardian</em>&rsquo;s VR demo lacks in length or depth, it makes up for with sheer heart. Calling Trico over, gazing directly into its excitedly glowing eyes, and then having it nuzzle me is the most powerful moment I&rsquo;ve experienced yet in VR. I couldn&rsquo;t stop smiling. You can&rsquo;t always predict what Trico will do, which is part of what makes it feel so real, in both the game and the VR demo. When I threw a barrel past its head at one point, I expected Trico to chase it. Instead, it turned and gave me its paw (or rather, its massive avian claw-foot) like an eager puppy.</p><p>The demo also re-creates some of the game&rsquo;s iconic moments, like flying on Trico&rsquo;s back. When it sits and looks at you expectantly, it&rsquo;s a clear sign that you should jump up for a ride. Clinging on while Trico climbs rickety scaffolding is thrilling, even if it&rsquo;s entirely non-interactive. There&rsquo;s even a slow-motion sequence where you leap across a chasm and nearly plummet to the ground, before Trico snatches you in its beak at the last second. In the final scene, you don&rsquo;t even have to do anything. You just stand there watching while Trico scratches behind its ear, taking in the breathtaking view of a crumbling kingdom down below.</p><p>Virtual reality is often talked about in terms of places. It can transport you anywhere, with a level of immersion not possible with traditional games. But <em>The Last Guardian</em> shows another very powerful aspect of the medium: being able to interact with virtual beings in a way that feels arresting and natural. With its distinct personality and lifelike animations, Trico already felt like a shockingly realistic digital creature outside VR. But the headset takes that idea to another level. Looking up at Trico gives you an unparalleled sense of its sheer size, and its face is even more expressive when viewed up close. Sure, VR can send you to Mars or even to Hell &mdash; but there&rsquo;s nothing quite like staring directly into the eyes of giant cat-dog.</p>', 'VR,heartwarming,Last Guardian', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),

In order to sift through all the data that it&rsquo;s captured since that launch, scientists usually look at the strongest signals first. And that process has worked well enough so far. NASA has confirmed 2,525 exoplanets in that time, a number that has changed our understanding of how common it is to find planets around the stars that make up our galaxy.</p><p>Recently, though, artificial intelligence has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/15/16654352/ai-astronomy-space-exploration-data">become a more prominent tool in astronomy</a>. Scientists &mdash; including ones who work on the Kepler data &mdash; have increasingly turned to machine learning to help sort through typically lower-priority data to see what they might have missed. In the process, they found an overlooked planet that&rsquo;s now named Kepler-90i.</p><p>But while we now know that Kepler-90 has the same number of orbiting planets as our Sun, the solar system is a poor candidate in the search for extraterrestrial life &mdash; or at least, life as we know it (especially compared to something like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/22/14674088/7-planet-solar-system-discovered-conditions-for-life-water-nature-nasa">the planets that surround TRAPPIST-1</a>). Kepler-90 is about 20 percent bigger and 5 percent warmer than our Sun. And its eight planets dance around the star in much closer orbits than the ones in our own Solar System. In fact, their orbits are so comparatively small that seven of Kepler-90&rsquo;s eight planets <a href="https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/news/1476/discovery-of-eight-planets-makes-alien-system-the-first-to-tie-with-our-solar-system/">would fit in between the Earth and the Sun</a>.</p><p>The discovery of Kepler-90i, came after NASA let Google train its machine learning algorithms on 15,000 signals from potential planets in the Kepler database. The scientists then took the trained system and set it to work on data from 670 stars that were already known to have multiple planets, as they considered those to be the most likely hiding places. The newly discovered planet in Kepler-90, along with one other found in the Kepler-80 solar system announced today, are the first NASA was able to confirm from these new results from Google&rsquo;s AI.</p><p>The inclusion of machine learning in this process shouldn&rsquo;t scare humans whose livelihood revolves around discovering and studying exoplanets, according to Chris Shallue, a senior Google AI software engineer who worked on the project.</p><p>&ldquo;What we&rsquo;ve developed here is a tool to help astronomers have more impact,&rdquo; Shallue said on a conference call about the news. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a way to increase the productivity of astronomers. It certainly won&rsquo;t replace them at all.&rdquo;</p>', 'Google,AI,Solar System', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),

Now we know the identity of that vendor: it&#39;s Vivo.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickmoorhead/2017/12/14/synaptics-shipping-first-in-display-smartphone-fingerprint-reader-to-vivo/#71ac1eb832f4">post for <em>Forbes</em></a>, analyst Patrick Moorhead detailed his experience with a pre-production Vivo phone equipped with the technology. Moorhead describes the sensor as &ldquo;fast and simple,&rdquo; while Synaptics claims it&#39;s twice as fast as 3D facial recognition like Apple&#39;s Face ID &mdash; though that&#39;d be a hard thing to realistically measure considering the different mechanisms that each system uses in practice.</p><p>Integrating fingerprint sensors into displays is seen as a way to include convenient biometric authentication on phones with &ldquo;all-screen&rdquo; designs. (Apple, of course, abandoned fingerprint sensors altogether with the face-scanning iPhone X.) And however well it works, Vivo&#39;s decision to go with Synaptics seems like a blow to Qualcomm, which has also been working on the tech. Vivo showed off a Qualcomm-powered fingerprint-sensing display prototype <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/28/15885502/qualcomm-under-display-fingerprint-sensor-apple-samsung">earlier this year</a>, but it was said to be noticeably slow.</p><p>Vivo might not be the first name that comes to mind when you think of major smartphone vendors, but it is one of the world&#39;s biggest phone brands. It was ranked fifth in IDC&#39;s Q1 2017 report, and while it went down to sixth in Q2, you could make the case for bundling it with fourth-placed Oppo since it shares the same parent company, BBK Electronics. Oppo also owns OnePlus, which is a much smaller brand but likely more familiar to Western readers. And Vivo&#39;s recent success in India now sees it ranked third in the country, which Moorhead suggests will return the brand to IDC&#39;s top five.</p>', 'fingerprint sensor,in-screen,phone', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),

The software giant is rolling out <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2017/12/19/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-17063-pc/">Windows 10 build 17063</a> to Fast Ring testers, complete with the Timeline feature and the new window tabs the company revealed last month.</p><p>Timeline was originally supposed to ship with the Fall Creators Update, allowing Windows 10 machines to resume apps and activities across devices. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/11/15610612/microsoft-windows-10-timeline-feature">Timeline will let you effectively pick up where you left off</a> if you&#39;re switching between Windows 10 devices. Thanks to Cortana integration, this will even extend to some Microsoft apps on iOS and Android eventually. It&#39;s a quick way to move from one machine to another, much like Apple&#39;s continuity feature in iOS and macOS.</p><p>In this latest build, Timeline can be accessed through the usual Task View area in Windows 10. Timeline provides a visual overview of all recent activities, including apps that were running on a Windows 10 PC at a particular time. It&rsquo;s similar to the recent tabs feature in Chrome, where you can resume sets of tabs you were viewing on another device. Cortana will also prompt Windows 10 users to resume these activities thanks to the Timeline feature.</p><p>Alongside Timeline, Microsoft is also testing out Sets &mdash; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/28/16709190/microsoft-windows-10-tabs-file-explorer-sets-feature">its tabbed window feature</a>. Microsoft admits it may end up calling it something else by the time it ships, and the company is only testing Sets with a limited number of Windows Insiders today. Sets add tabs to windows so that activities can be grouped into a single interface. It&rsquo;s very much tabbed browsing but for every Windows 10 app. Only Universal Windows Apps will be supported initially, with this extending to Office and win32 apps next year.</p><p>Microsoft has also added a number of new features elsewhere in this latest test version of Windows 10. Microsoft Edge picks up an updated dark theme with better contrast and more of the company&rsquo;s Fluent Design system in action. Gestures have also been improved for precision touchpads, allowing you to pinch and zoom on a trackpad and more.</p><p>Cortana is also getting a new design in this latest build, with a new Organizer home. You can manage lists and reminders from this interface, and access all the skills available in Cortana. Cortana even has a tabbed view to better separate content, and you can now use the digital assistant to control music playback through Spotify.</p><p>Microsoft is also bringing more of its Fluent Design to Windows 10. The taskbar, action center, clock &amp; calendar, and share UI have all been updated with subtle changes. Even the My People section of Windows 10 is seeing some tweaks, with a drag and drop rearrange feature and the ability to decide how many people are pinned to the taskbar. Windows 10&rsquo;s settings section is also getting redesigned to make it easier to find individual settings.</p><p>This latest Windows 10 test build also includes more DPI improvements. Microsoft has been battling for years to fix DPI scaling issues in Windows, and the company is now introducing a new setting in the display settings to let Windows automatically fix scaling for apps. This is helpful if you remote into your PC, or if you dock your laptop to a monitor and the resolution and scaling changes. You can also override DPI settings per app. Microsoft&rsquo;s new Windows 10 build includes a lot more changes</p>', 'Microsoft,Windows 10,features', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),
